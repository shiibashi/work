2016-01-01,"A publicist for Robert Redford has confirmed the   icon is alive and well after a hoax news report of his death circulated rapidly on Twitter on New Year’s Eve. [Social media was set ablaze for a brief time on Thursday with reports that the      had died after falling from a golf cart in Santa Monica, California. A fake Twitter account purporting to be Britain’s Sky News had tweeted out the fake news of Redford’s death.  Social media users quickly posted “RIP” tributes to the   screen legend as the hoax spread. But Cindi Berger, Redford’s publicist, worked quickly to assure fans that the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid star had fallen victim to a “sick” Internet hoax. “This is a sick hoax. I just spoke to him and there is no truth to this whatsoever,” Berger said in a statement to Reuters, saying the actor was at home, alive and well. Redford, who does not have an account on Twitter, did not immediately issue a comment of his own. The fake Twitter account that sparked the hoax has in the past reportedly spread other false reports about celebrity deaths, including that of actor John Travolta. The account has since been suspended by Twitter. Redford currently stars as Dan Rather in the   “Rathergate” film Truth and will reportedly attend the Sundance Film Festival, an event he   in Utah later this month."
2016-01-02," The email appears to back up a claim made by Virginia GOP chairman John Whitbeck last week, when he said on the radio that the party had informed the Trump campaign on Sept. 8 about the possibility of asking those who want to vote on the Republican side of the state’s open primary to sign such a statement. Days later on the same radio show, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said that the assertion that the campaign had been informed of this and failed to object were “just not accurate. ” The Trump campaign has strongly objected to the statement in recent weeks, with the Donald himself taking to Twitter on Sunday to say that the RPV is “working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. ” But an   dated Sept. 8 from RPV executive director John Findlay addressed to Trump national political director Michael Glassner says that requirements to participate in the Republican primary “may include, but shall not be limited to, the signing of a pledge by the voter of his intention to support the party’s candidate when offering to vote in the primary. ” The   further states, “RPV is currently exploring having a statement of intent for the March Primary. It is a must that the statement be worded to allow for members of the military and federal employees to participate in our process. ” It adds that part of the goal of the statement would be to “attempt to collect   addresses of voters. ” The   obtained by BuzzFeed News did not include an attachment referenced in the email that allegedly contained a draft of the statement.  A memo dated Dec. 29 and addressed from the executive director of the RPV to the State Central Committee adds that the Trump campaign did not respond to the   for 3 months. It says that they were finally contacted by the Trump campaign about the “statement of affiliation” on Dec. 9. They allegedly contacted the campaign by phone the same day and then in writing on Dec. 19. It is unclear what was said in that correspondence. Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager, said on Christmas Eve that the campaign has asked the party “to come back to us with what the final language is going to be. And as of right now, nobody knows what that final language is going to be. ”  The party released a statement on Dec. 17 saying that the statement will read, “My signature below indicates that I am a Republican,” without any further statement of intent. The memo further offers a debriefing on the controversy surrounding the statement. As Whitbeck, the RPV chairman, did last week, it argues that “the Statement of Affiliation is not designed to favor or hurt any candidate whatsoever. The purpose of the Statement is to build our Party and prevent Democrats from voting in the March 1st Republican Presidential Primary. ”  “Had the Trump campaign responded prior to the meeting, our Party would have alerted our members to their feedback at the September State Central meeting when the Statement of Affiliation was voted on,” it says, adding later that the RPV has “treated all candidates equally. ” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2016-01-03,"The beginning of a new year is a busy time for new singles. According to the websites Match. com and PlentyOfFish, Jan. 3 is the busiest day of the year for new signups to their sites. But those are just two in the plethora of dating apps and websites. There are big names like Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge. But there are lots of niche apps that target specific groups. For example, there’s JDate and JSwipe for Jews Tindog connects dogs and owners alike High There is for marijuana enthusiasts and of course there’s Sizzl, exclusively for bacon lovers. As people spend more time on their phones, much of the dating world has moved there with them. So what happened to meeting people in person? Lisa Bonos tried to find out. Bonos writes and edits pieces about single life and dating for The Washington Post’s   blog. She recently took a   break from dating apps and tried to meet people IRL. Bonos chronicled her app fast in a recent blog post and talked about what she learned with NPR’s Michel Martin. On how important the Internet is for modern dating, If you want to be meeting people and going on dates on a regular basis, yes, it’s important. If you want to go on one date a week, you are going to have to enlist the Internet, or all of your friends, to set you up. On the increased pressure she felt going offline, Anytime I was in a situation where there might be single people, like a bar or party, which did not happen every night, I would be like, ”Oh, my gosh, I’m in a situation where I could meet someone. I need to talk to more than one person.” In one situation I ended up talking to two people and cutting off a perfectly good conversation to go talk to somebody [else]. Turned out, he was married. On what she learned from the experience, My takeaway from the time away is that I might do it more often. Just take a breath when I’m feeling overwhelmed. I might not say, ”For three months I’m not going to use the apps.” But maybe two days or three days."
2016-01-04,"Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) is calling on the protesters occupying a federal building in Burns, Oregon to “stand down. ”[“Every one of us has a constitutional right to protest, to speak our minds,” Cruz told reporters in Iowa on Monday.  “But we don’t have a constitutional right to use force and violence and to threaten force and violence against others. ” He added that, “it is our hope that the protesters there will stand down peaceably, that there will not be a violent confrontation. ” Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) also weighed in, during an interview on Iowa radio station KBUR on Monday. “You can’t be lawless. We live in a republic,” Rubio said. “There are ways to change the laws of this country and the policies. If we get frustrated with it, that’s why we have elections. That’s why we have people we can hold accountable. ” The protests are being led by Ammon Bundy, son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy. As Breitbart News’ Brandon Darby has reported, the protests began over the prison sentences of two local ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond."
2016-01-05,"From the mundane to the bizarre, everything seemed to include a hashtag in global development this year. There was #EarthtoParis for the climate change meeting in Paris. There was #WorldToiletDay for you guessed it. And there was #MugabeFalls, which helped turn Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe into a cheeky meme after he literally fell on the red carpet during a rally. We combed through a year of #wordsstrungtogetherlikethis to find the hashtags that made a mark  —   and found a few trends: busting stereotypes in the developing world, championing big global campaigns, playing off the news and goofing around, too. A lot of the hashtags used photos to drive home the message. ”One thing that has been unique this year in hashtags is visual imagery,” says Jason Wojciechowski, creative director of Corelab, an agency that runs digital campaigns for global development organizations. ”For each hashtag, there’s been one or two photos that speak to what the issue is really all about  —   like the photo of Aylan Kurdi on the beach or the photo of Justin Trudeau greeting Syrian refugees to Canada for #RefugeesWelcome.” For Wojciechowski and his team, who have created social media strategies for the Malala Fund, the United Nations and Rock the Vote, hashtags create the biggest waves when they are authentic, simple and clear. He thinks there will be more of them this year  —   and he predicts that it’s not just a numbers game. ”You don’t need millions of people using a hashtag,” says Wojciechowski. ”You need the right people with the right message at the right time.” Here’s our list: #TheAfricaTheMediaNeverShowsYou, Fed up with oversimplified stereotypes about Africa, people across the continent tweeted photos of beautiful landscapes, beaches and architecture to combat the images of drought, disease and disaster often featured in media stories about Africa. The hashtag, #TheAfricaTheMediaNeverShowsYou, started trending in June and was tweeted nearly 45, 000 times in just a month. #BeingFemaleInNigeria, In June, members of a tiny book club in Abuja, Nigeria, started tweeting about sexist moments they’ve experienced, prompted by a discussion of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s ”We Should All Be Feminists” TedTalk. Soon, thousands were tweeting about the big and small frustrations of #BeingFemaleInNigeria  —   as well as the strength of Nigerian women. #HappyToBleed, Many Hindu temples across India ask women to stay away while they’re menstruating. Then the new president of the Sabarimala temple in Kerala, which bans all women of reproductive age, said he’d consider allowing women if and when there’s a machine that can detect if they’re bleeding. Student activist Nikita Azad took a stand with the hashtag #HappyToBleed. Women in India and around the world started speaking out against menstrual taboos using the tag. Many changed their profile photos to depict sanitary napkins and tampons. #GlobalGoals, In September, the U. N. General Assembly passed its new Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty by 2030. But the public began hearing about the goals months before when the U. N. and its partners created the hashtag #GlobalGoals.   One Direction and celebrities like Mindy Kaling and John Legend lent their voices, along with a   directory of global nonprofits. #SelfieWithDaughter, To promote gender equality and girls’ education, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked Indian moms and dads to tweet photos of themselves with their daughters. The hashtag, part of Modi’s ”Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” (Save the Daughter, Educate the Daughter) campaign, was an instant hit  —   and prompted thousands of submissions from celebrities, politicians and Indians the world over. #62MillionGirls, In September and October, first lady Michelle Obama rallied the public, nonprofits and celebs  —   including Beyonce, Misty Copeland and Kerry Washington  —   to use the hashtag #62milliongirls to raise awareness for the number of girls around the world who are not in school. It’s part of Let Girls Learn, her initiative with USAID. #147NotJustANumber, In April, Kenyan activist Ory Okolloh Mwangi started the hashtag #147NotJustANumber to put a human face on the terrorist attack that killed 148 people at the Garissa University College in eastern Kenya. People shared photos and biographical details of the students, ages 19 to 23, who were killed by   gunmen.   #RefugeesWelcome, In September, thousands of people used the hashtag #refugeeswelcome to tell their governments to open up their borders to Syrian refugees. This came after images of Syrian refugees trying to escape to Europe in overcrowded boats  —   and the image of    Aylan Kurdi, a Syrian refugee boy found drowned on a beach in Turkey. #IfAfricaWasABar  Taking a cue from a classic prompt to help overcome writer’s block, writer Siyanda Moutsiwa, from Botswana, asked this question on Twitter: ”If Africa was a bar, what would your country be  ?” Her tweet became one of the hippest   hashtags of the summer, fueling a feed of satirical quips and memes.  #NigeriansatHogwarts, Nigerians across the world imagine what it would be like if they went to Hogwarts, the wizardry school from the Harry Potter books. ”The #NigeriansAtHogwarts hashtag is EVERYTHING, throwing inside jokes, cultural stereotypes and our unfuggwitable humor into a giant bowl,” wrote blogger Luvvie Ajayi, who goes by ”Awesomely Luvvie.” What was your favorite hashtag in global development?

2016-01-06,"On Wall Street, the real holiday cheer is just around the corner. It’s bonus season on the Street, and   and   are going to start telling their bankers and traders about their annual pay bump next week, The Post has learned. The 2015 bonus pools for investment bankers and bond and equity traders are expected to be about flat or slightly down at the two banks after a mixed year as bond desks suffered the most, two people with knowledge of the bonuses told The Post. While bond trading desks across Wall Street saw their worst year since the 2008 financial crisis, bank profits were buoyed by lower legal costs and   revenues from mergers and acquisition advisory and investment banking. Bonuses on Wall Street are hotly debated and anticipated, and could mean two or three times an annual salary for even the most junior of employees. They’re also a source of pressure for banks in a tough environment, since star employees who feel they aren’t well compensated are more likely to pack up and go to a rival.  the largest US bank by assets, told employees last year that it plans to keep its bonus pool about the same as last year  —   a move that was widely seen as a way to keep its employees happy.  however, has been slashing costs under its new Chief Executive John Cryan, and many of its employees will see vast reductions  —   or nothing at all. Last year, Wall Street got a 2 percent increase in bonuses overall for their work in 2014  —   but most of that increase came from a rise in deferred stock values, according to data released in March from New York State comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley and Citi declined to comment."
2016-01-07,"Macy’s, which operates the upscale Bloomingdale’s chain as well as its namesake Macy’s department stores, estimated that 80 percent of the fall was due to unusually warm weather, which discouraged purchases of sweaters, coats and gloves. It also blamed the strong dollar for keeping tourists from visiting the United States and spending money at its flagship stores.    The company’s shares rose 2. 8 percent to $37. 15 in   trading on Wednesday as investors cheered its plan to reduce costs by $400 million by consolidating regions and  . The jobs to be eliminated include 3, 000 store workers, though about half of those employees will be put in other positions, as well as hundreds of   and senior executive posts, the company said in a press release.    “Macy’s is cutting the fat, becoming a leaner organization,” said Lisa Haddock, marketing lecturer at San Diego State University, of why the shares rose.    But Haddock said Macy’s, like many other traditional   mortar retailers, faced an uncertain future as more and more consumer demand shifted online. ”Macy’s doesn’t seem to have a unique spot in consumers’ minds,” she said.    Macy’s cut its earnings forecast for the full year to   to $3. $3. 90 per share, excluding charges associated with the   program, from its previous forecast of $4. 20 to $4. 30 per share.    In November Macy’s had also blamed warm weather and low spending by tourists in cutting its guidance for the year and flagging a   of unsold apparel inventory.    ”The holiday selling season was challenging, as experienced throughout 2015 by much of the retailing industry,” Macy’s chief executive, Terry Lundgren, said in Wednesday’s press release.    The latest warning from Macy’s also reflects ongoing shifts in the retail industry, analysts said. A growing number of consumers are refraining from buying discretionary items such as clothes and cosmetics, while spending more on electronics, cars, home goods and travel.     At the same Amazon. com Inc ( ) has revolutionized shopping habits, conditioning shoppers to expect deeper discounts than what    retailers can afford, while speeding up delivery in an effort to lure shoppers.    ”It’s really concerning news that a company as well managed as Macy’s is having such a tough time growing sales,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. ”It’s a broader issue. It’s an acceleration of a retail ice age.”    Flickinger said other department stores and specialty clothing stores are likely facing similar troubles with apparel demand.      Macy’s said it expects a 2. 7 percent drop in   sales for the year ending January, bigger than the 1. 8  .2 percent decline it previously forecast.    Macy’s said it will close 36 of its 770 stores early this spring, in line with a previously announced plan.    In addition to store employees, it said it would cut 600   jobs, with about 150 of those positions to be reassigned. The company will shut its St. Louis call center in the spring, affecting about 750 employees, while adding 640 positions to other call centers. It will also offer a ”voluntary separation program” for 165 senior executives at Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s.    Macy’s said it would record about $200 million in charges related to the   program.

2016-01-08,"‘Common Core, the set of education standards that were adopted by 46 states five years ago but have since become toxic with the conservative base, has not been at the center of the Republican primary debate, which has so far been dominated by national security and immigration,” according to an article in The Hill just a few weeks ago. How quickly things change. In the final four weeks before the voting begins, Senator Marco Rubio is making opposition to Common Core a key part of his final pitch.  The   super PAC Conservative Solutions features it in a new television ad: “One   Common Core,    Obamacare   president is enough,” the voiceover says. It’s a smart move for Rubio, first and foremost because Common Core is an issue that deeply moves voters, especially important in a caucus state such as Iowa. Second, it distinguishes Rubio from Chris Christie, who was an early supporter of Common Core but who has changed his position to oppose it more recently, at least in part. Common Core is a policy failure as well. The state of Kentucky has been implementing Common Core for four years, the longest of any state, and certainly long enough that one would expect to see some positive results. Instead, Ed Week reports, the proportion of Kentucky elementary and   students who are proficient in reading and math dropped by  . Senator Rubio has promised to reverse any executive order promoting Common Core that President Obama has signed. But here’s the problem: There is a big disconnect between what GOP presidential candidates are saying and what the GOP Congress is doing about Common Core. A candidate who wants to really repeal Common Core’s federal intrusion is now going to have to run not just against President Obama, but against the December betrayal by the   House and Senate, which passed a major education reform that institutionalizes federal control over the curriculum Obama improvised. Yes, I know there’s a sentence in that bill that forbids any effort to foist a curriculum on a state. But it is unenforceable, especially since other explicit provisions of the bill give the federal government broad new powers over state education curriculums, tying the hands of the Common Core moms seeking to reassert control over their children’s education. For the first time in U. S. history, states will be required to submit a “  and  ” education plan to the Department of Education, which, also for the first time, has the explicit authority to judge and disapprove state education plans. As I wrote on December 11, right after the GOP’s silent swift passage: “In other words, Arne Duncan will not have to manipulate waivers to exert pressure on states to adopt the Common Core, because the new   statute explicitly gives him that authority. ” You don’t believe me? Believe Arne Duncan, architect of Obamacore, who crowed to reporters that the bill gave him everything he wanted: “I’m stunned at how much better it ended up than either [the House or the Senate] bill going into conference. I had a Democratic congressman say to me that it’s a miracle  —   he’s literally never seen anything like it. . . . If you look at the substance of what is there . . . embedded in the law are the values that we’ve promoted and proposed forever. The core of our agenda from Day One, that’s all in there  —   early childhood, high standards [i. e. Common Core] not turning a blind eye when things are bad. For the first time in our nation’s history, that’s the letter of the law. ” Or listen to what Peter Cunningham, a former Obama education aide, said in response to claims by Senator Lamar Alexander (R. Tenn.) that the new bill kills Common Core: “The new law that the senator from Tennessee is so proud of . . . now mandates the very thing he rails against. ” Cunningham explains: “Under the new law, every state must adopt ‘  and  ’ standards. Thus, the new law all but guarantees that Common Core State Standards  —   or a reasonable imitation under a different name  —   will likely remain in place in most states. ” Rubio has raised the profile of the issue. But will he be the one to emerge as a real hero by promising to repeal this legislation  —   the Every Student Succeeds Act  —   or will he let the Republican betrayal stand? Ted Cruz has just released a YouTube video announcing a homeschooling coalition and slamming Common Core. The Grand Forks Herald reports that Cruz in his closing pitch is promising to end Common Core  —   and abolish the Department of Education to boot. Will he be the one to do it? This is an opportunity for Rubio or Cruz to take on the dysfunction of Republicans in Washington, so vividly on display just a few weeks ago on Common Core.  —   Maggie Gallagher is the author of four books on marriage and is a longtime contributor to National Review.

2016-01-09,"In 1982, when I washed up on NPR’s doorstep looking for a job, I started a pickup basketball game. It endures to this day. That’s right, we are in our 33rd season, which makes me too old to still be playing . .. and yet, somehow, I still am. Every Wednesday night over the decades, a group of guys  —   including an array of NPR staffers  —   has come together to run full court in a rented gym. We’ve had journalists, carpenters, doctors, locksmiths, IT guys, military guys, lawyers, and at least one top White House staffer . .. this is D. C. after all. Often, we know little about each other’s personal lives and would never recognize each other with long pants on. One of the   is Bernard Ohanian, who characterizes the game this way: ”When it’s really clicking, it’s like a jazz symphony,” he says. ”And most of the time, it’s like a bad garage band.” Bernard says the game endures because everyone’s friendly and plays hard. ”There’s no jerks in the game,” he says. ”Anyone who’s ever played pickup basketball knows that’s not always the case. And the friendships and relationships you build up over a number of years, it just feels right, it feels part of my life.” NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie was an   player in high school and is one of the last original members of the group still playing. He has been part of my   life for a long, long time. ”I know your every move,” he tells me  —   including the fact that I can’t go left. John is a consistent threat from the outside and along the baseline. And it’s these moves that keep him coming back week after week. ”Every now and then, I do something that feels like it felt when I was 20 years old and it just feels so great. And you realize you were once really good at this thing. And I’m not very good at it anymore, but it’s still fun. It’s just great fun.” For Ohanian, long running games run in the family. His dad played with a bunch of friends from the time they were 15 until well into their golden years. According to Bernard, one of the regulars was a guy named Bob who had been fouling everyone since World War II. But he would never admit it. Well, during one game in the   Bernard was playing with the group when Bob hacked another old timer named Joe one time too many. ”And Joe says, ’foul,’ ” says Bernard. ”And Bob just looks incredulous and he says, ’Joe, I didn’t foul you.’ And you could see this stuff simmering in Joe like you’re holding it in all these years. And he slams the ball down on the floor and he says, ’Damn it, Bob, it was a foul in 1945 and it’s a foul today!’ ” When we first started playing, almost everybody was in their early 30s, but over the years, the original cast of characters dwindled. Some left town. Some were felled by torn ligaments. Others were pulled away by marriage and kids, and yet others just got too old and creaky. And most often, young guys, like newcomer Dan Blank, have taken their place. He was born in 1983, the year after the game started. I’m pretty sure I’m older than his parents. But Dan says that the   guys can keep up. ”A lot of guys out here have some very sneaky speed. Every now and then I think I can just jog down and keep pace and then they zoom right past me, so I don’t take anything for granted the way I did the first game,” he says. Dan is likely just being nice. And Bernard Ohanian says that’s one of the hallmarks of this game . .. especially when one of the seniors hits the deck. ”When any of us really older guys dives for a ball and we’re on the ground or we fall, the young guys are standing over us, ’You all right, you all right, you all right?’ I think they’re afraid we’re going to die on the court.” I guess that would be one of those, ”At least he died doing what he loved” moments. When talk turns to finally retiring from the game, John says, not yet. ”You know I keep thinking, I suppose there’s a time will come we have to hang it up. But it’s not next week. And I don’t think it’s next year. Yeah I don’t know. Just keep going until I can’t go anymore.” Over the years, I’ve broken my nose, cracked my ribs, torn muscles and sprained my ankles. My jump shot percentage is approaching that of   milk, and my reflexes have gone from catlike to  . And yet, I keep playing because the game I’ve practiced since I was 9 years old keeps toying with me. Just when it seems like I can’t raise the embarrassment bar any higher, I’ll have a great night. Or a least a great game. I’ll hit most of my shots, and maybe even a  . And then I know, I’ll be back next Wednesday night."
2016-01-10,"’  mogul Donald Trump said on Saturday that North Korea’’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, deserves ”credit” for taking over his country at such a young age.’ ’”If you look at North Korea, this guy, I mean, he’’s like a maniac, OK? And you’’ve got to give him credit. How many young guys  —   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died  —   take over these tough generals,” Trump said in Ottumwa, Iowa.’ ’The Republican presidential   said Kim’’s willingness to push aside generals and ”wipe out” his uncle demonstrated why the US needs to treat North Korea’’s nuclear arsenal as a serious threat.’ ’”And all of a sudden  —   and you know it’’s pretty amazing when you think of it  —   how does he do that? Even though it is a culture and it’’s a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes over, and he’’s the boss,” Trump recalled. ”It’’s incredible. He wiped out the uncle. He wiped out this one, that one. I mean, this guy doesn’’t play games. And we can’’t play games with him. Because he really does have missiles. And he really does have nukes. ”’ ”North Korea drew worldwide condemnation earlier this week when . If true, North Korea’s nuclear weapons would have to the potential to be far more devastating. However,  that the erratic North Korean regime had actually tested a more conventional nuclear weapon.” ”During his Iowa speech on Saturday, Trump also said his plan to   the region is for the US to put pressure on China, which has been North Korea’s longtime benefactor. The billionaire businessman accused the Chinese government of ripping the US off for years.” ’”Here’’s what we do. We tell China,” Trump said. ”We rebuilt China. They have taken so much of our money with trade. They have taken everything. They have taken our jobs, our money. . .. They’’ve taken so much. And literally, it’’s one of the great thefts in the history of the world, what they’’ve done to our country. ”’"
2016-01-11,"Sen. Rand Paul ( ) fanned the Ted   flames yet again, telling Fox News Monday that the Texas senator is a ”  Canadian” and that it’s up to the courts to decide whether Cruz is eligible for president. ”Cruz is a   Canadian,” Paul said, according to CNN. ”He was naturally born there. The question is, can you be   Canadian and   American at the same time? Maybe, but I think the courts will have to decide it, because it’s never really been decided.” ”For traditional citizenship it always has been (your parent) but the only part of the Constitution that says ’ ’ is with regard to the President. So it appears to be a unique qualification and most people have interpreted they had to be born in the U. S. until recently,” Paul said on Fox. ”So I think eventually the Supreme Court will probably have to decide it.” Last week, Paul said that Cruz ”is qualified and would make the cut to be prime minister of Canada.” The question of Cruz’s Canadian birth    he was born to a U. S. mother in Canada, which at the time, legally made him a U. S. citizen    has come to the forefront of the 2016 race after Cruz’s chief rival Donald Trump called it it a ”a very precarious” situation. Plenty of GOP candidates and Republicans have defended Cruz’s eligibility, but Trump and others are suggesting that if he becomes the nominee Democrats will sue to block his candidacy. Cruz has dismissed the idea that he is not a   citizen as ”political noise. ”"
2016-01-12,"Although New Year’s confetti is still being cleaned off the floors, Paul Ryan already issued a statement that could easily be a contender for the most remarkable statement of 2016. In a Monday interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Paul Ryan declared without a trace of humor that “People who know my record know that I’m for border enforcement, border control, not for amnesty. ”[But a review of Paul Ryan’s record demonstrates a   history of pushing amnesty and mass immigration. In fact, Ryan has developed perhaps the most open borders record in Congress —   for members of either party. And Ryan was instrumental in blocking an effort to reduce immigration in the 1990’s, changing forever the course of American history.  In the interview with Tapper, Ryan was asked about criticisms levied against him by GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for being “weak on immigration: “Frankly I’m disappointed that he’s weak on immigration, he’s weak on the border, and he’s in favor of amnesty, so I have my disappointments with him,” Trump said of Ryan. Although Trump is indeed correct, Ryan told Tapper in response, “Look, I’m not taking the bait. I’m not going to get into the commenting about this and that  …     People who know my record know that I’m for border enforcement, border control, not for amnesty. ” Ryan’s declaration, which went unchallenged by Tapper, contradicts the entire history of Ryan’s career. Indeed, as recently as just last month, Speaker Ryan ushered through Congress an omnibus spending bill that completely funded President Obama’s   2012 executive amnesty for DREAMers. His bill also gave federal grants to sanctuary cities, as well as funding the resettlement of illegal aliens within the United States, the release of criminal aliens, and tax credits for illegal aliens. Meanwhile, Ryan’s omnibus failed to provide funding for the mandatory completion of a     border fence that Congress promised the American people with the 2006 Secure Fence Act —  even as Speaker Ryan constructed his own   security fence around his posh mansion in Janesville, Wisconsin. Yet far from simply funding amnesty, Ryan’s omnibus funded an expansion of immigration levels. Ryan’s spending bill funded an expansion of Muslim migration, bringing the total number of visas for Muslim migrants this year (temporary and permanent) to about 300, 000. His omnibus also expanded a controversial     guest worker program, which immigration attorney Ian Smith has explained will disproportionately “hurt America’s most vulnerable workers. ”  Without providing any evidence to support his claim, Ryan sought to justify the controversial provision by declaring that American “businesses would have shut down with this” provision “because they couldn’t get the labor. ” Ryan made this claim despite the fact that 92 million Americans are currently outside the labor force. Sen. Tom Cotton declared that this provision was a direct violation of Ryan’s pledge not to bring up major immigration legislation while President Obama was still in office. Cottton wrote: It’s especially disappointing that the new House leadership, in fewer than two months on the job, broke its promise not to bring major immigration legislation to the floor this year. One must wonder how many other promises in the Capitol have an expiration date. But one need not wonder why our voters are in open rebellion and our presidential candidates are successfully running against Congress. Similarly, in a November interview with Sean Hannity, Ryan ruled out the possibility of curbing Muslim migration, instead adopting the rhetoric of President Obama and declaring —   contrary to what current U. S. immigration law mandates —   that “a religious test is not appropriate” to screen foreign migrants. Ryan told Hannity that considering a foreign national’s religion during the immigration process would be fundamentally   —   insisting “That’s not who we are. ” Ryan also denounced Trump’s plan to temporarily pause Muslim migration, stating: “This is not conservatism. What [Trump proposed]  …     is not what this party stands for and more importantly it’s not what this country stands for. ” Conservative legend Phyllis Schlafly declared that Ryan’s claim that restricting migration is not conservative is “absolutely wrong”: He’s absolutely wrong. I think all the polls show that the country is with Donald Trump on that issue  …      It is certainly not our duty to let in everybody who wants to come to this country. Probably the whole world wants to come into this country  …     We need to respect the will of the majority. Republicans ought to be a grassroots party. And the grassroots certainly agree with Donald Trump on most issues, but certainly on the immigration issue. Ryan’s record of pushing for open borders immigration policies extends far beyond just the past few months. Indeed, Ryan’s effort to expand America’s immigration levels beyond all known historical precedent dates back more than two decades. As Roy Beck, president of the immigration control group NumbersUSA, told Breitbart exclusively last October, Ryan “has spent his entire adulthood ideologically connected to the open borders crowd. Open Borders is in his ideological DNA. That’s the terrifying thing. He’s an ideologue and has spent his whole life working for ideologues. Open borders seeps out of every pore of his being. This isn’t personal, it’s just who he is  …     Paul Ryan is the heart and soul of crony capitalism. ” Bloomberg’s John Heilemann’s previous reporting documents Beck’s declaration. “[Ryan’s] ties to the   mafia ran deep,” Heilemann wrote nearly two decades ago. In a 1996 piece for Wired magazine, Heilemann detailed Ryan’s involvement in the effort to kill the bipartisan push to curb immigration —   led by Republican Congressman Lamar Smith and inspired by Civil Rights champion and   Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. Heilemann reports that Ryan, as Sam Brownback’s legislative director, teamed up with immigration expansionist Stuart Anderson to pen “a series of highly influential, deeply devastating ‘Dear Colleague’ letters educating their peers about the hazards of [Lamar] Smith’s bill [to slash immigration rates]. ” Beck explained that, because of his involvement in derailing the bipartisan immigration curbs: Ryan is a part of the group that created the massive immigration problem facing the nation today. As a direct result of Paul Ryan and Sam Brownback, there are an additional 10 million immigrants in the country [than we otherwise would have]  …     If not for the Ryan and Brownback efforts, we wouldn’t even be debating illegal immigration today. During the   the illegal population was less than 5 million. If   had been implemented that point, we would not have so many illegal immigrants in the country today. The whole illegal immigration problem is the responsibility of Brownback. In 2012, the Washington Times detailed how this was just one of many efforts Ryan was involved in to expand immigration: [Ryan] worked to water down the strict immigration limits in a bill Lamar Smith, Texas Republican, was working to pass in the    …     As a staffer in Washington, he worked for Jack Kemp and Sen. Sam Brownback  —   both of whom were part of the Republicans’   wing, and who fought crackdown efforts from within their own party  …     As a congressman, he voted for a 2002 legalization bill, praised the 2006 Senate immigration bill backed by Mr. Bush and   a 2009 Democratic bill that would have legalized immigrant farmworkers. More recently, in 2013, Ryan became one of Congress’s most ardent champions of Barack Obama, Marco Rubio, and Chuck Schumer’s shared immigration agenda. Ryan became Sen. Rubio’s counterpart in the House for leading the charge to enact Obama’s vision of   mass immigration into law. As the Center for Immigration Studies’ Mark Krikorian wrote at the time in a piece entitled, “Do Rubio, Ryan Really Trust Obama To Enforce The Law?” Marco Rubio has effectively endorsed President Obama’s approach to immigration, and that endorsement was in turn endorsed by Paul Ryan. Or, as Julia Preston put it in the New York Times yesterday, ‘Strikingly, Mr. Rubio’s principles did not sound that different from proposals for an immigration overhaul by Mr. Obama, Democratic leaders and a handful of other Republicans.’ Indeed, shortly thereafter Paul Ryan joined forces with   advocate Luis Gutierrez —   who once declared, “I have only one loyalty  …    and that’s to the immigrant community” —   to stump for Marco Rubio’s immigration agenda. In fact, the two developed such a good relationship over the years that Gutierrez was one of Ryan’s earliest endorsements for House Speaker. Ryan’s Speakership was subsequently backed by other Democrats, such as Harry Reid and Xavier Becerra, before Congressman Jim Jordan, Mick Mulvaney, and the House Freedom Caucus helped push Paul Ryan over the finish line and into the Speaker’s chair.  Video footage of Gutierrez and Ryan’s efforts to sell the public on Rubio’s immigration agenda reveal Ryan’s deep commitment to amnesty. Ryan told their audience that American lawmakers “have to” and “need” to enact amnesty and expedited citizenship to illegal immigrants. “We have to offer people a path to earned legalization,” Ryan said. “We need to make sure that the children who are here, who are brought here, who did not choose to come here, who were brought by their parents —   that they have an ability to earn citizenship in a far faster way. ” In a separate video with Gutierrez, Ryan made the case for open borders —  declaring unabashedly, “America is more than just a country  …     It’s more than our borders. America is an idea. It’s a very precious idea. ” As Breitbart has previously explained, this statement is significant because, while a country has borders, “ideas” do not. If America is an “idea” rather than a “country,” then refugees in Somali have as much “right” to a job in the United States as do children whose ancestors fought in the American revolution. Ryan continued, “We want an economic based immigration system where  …      labor and supply and demand can meet each other so we can help fuel our economy and create jobs. ” Ryan’s declaration represents the essence of the open borders philosophy. Under this global   theory, any willing employer should be able to hire any willing worker regardless of what country they live in. This view —   that America is an “idea” and not a “nation” —   sees borders as an obstacle to commerce. Sen. Rubio echoed a similar refrain earlier this year in the first Republican debate, in which he complained that the nation’s federal immigration policy does not do enough to serve the interests of foreign citizens living in foreign countries who call Sen. Rubio’s office because the wait times for entry are too long. Rubio said, “And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates. The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they’ve paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can’t get in. ” A PBS Frontline documentary, which aired in October of 2015, further exposed the details of Gutierrez and Ryan’s push to pass amnesty. “Paul Ryan and I talk,” Gutierrez told the filmmakers. “What we do with Ryan,” Gutierrez explained, “is he puts together a bunch of bills, one of which is legalization, and that’s the one we join him on. The legalization is good enough that I can go and say we need to get in bed. ” Gutierrez told filmmakers that their collaboration had to be conducted in secret, so as not to tip off Republican voters. “You feel like you have to kind of sneak around to have dinner with these guys,” Gutierrez’s communications director, Douglas Rivlin, said, referring to his secret meetings with House Republicans to push amnesty. “Unlike some of you [expletive deleted] I don’t mess around with my wife, so —  but let me tell you —  right? I feel like I’m sneaking around right on my party   …     when I have dinner with you guys,” he said. “Right,” Gutierrez confirmed. “We can’t tell people. That’s OK. Maybe that’s the way this has got to get done. But if those are the rules, those are the rules. ” Another Republican lawmaker, with whom Gutierrez was working closely during this time, is   and a mass migration supporter, Congressman Trey Gowdy —   who recently endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for president. Like Ryan, Gowdy developed a close relationship with Gutierrez. As USA Today reported at the time, “In separate interviews, Gowdy and Gutierrez gushed about their mutual respect and trust. ” Gutierrez said of his friendship with Gowdy: “I think some things just happen because it’s meant to be  …     The chemistry is there. ” Ryan’s hardcore progressive stance on the critical issue of immigration prompted Phyllis Schlafly to question Ryan’s very ability to lead the Republican conference —   as Pew polling data reveals that 92% of the GOP electorate oppose Ryan’s desire for increased immigration levels. Schlafly was particularly critical of a 2013 declaration Ryan made in which he claimed that it was his job as a U. S. lawmaker to put himself in the shoes of foreign nationals and work to improve the lives for those foreign citizens. Ryan said: Put yourself in another person’s shoes, which if you’re in elected office, that’s what you kind of have to do that almost every single day  …     what we do is we take different people’s perspectives. The gentleman from India who’s waiting for his green card. The DREAMer who is waiting. We take all these different perspectives. We process it through our values and our morals and our principles. And then we come up with the answer to try and solve this problem. “That doesn’t sound like a good prescription for victory to me,” Schlafly told Breitbart exclusively. “The job of the leader of the Republicans in Congress is to help Republicans to win the next election, and to guide them along that path. And unfortunately I don’t think Ryan’s view of his job is correct at all. ” Although Ryan has sought to brand himself as a new generational leader, when Breitbart asked Schlafly if Ryan’s support for the  ’s trade and immigration agenda makes him more of a “candidate of yesterday” than a candidate of tomorrow, Schlafly declared unequivocally, “Yes, it does. ” Schlafly explained that Speaker Ryan has forced conservatives to refight issues, which they thought they had won by sending Republicans Congress: “Those are the issues we thought we beat when we elected a Republican Congress. It turned out we didn’t. ” Indeed, immigration is not the only issue where Paul Ryan backed President Obama. Like Sen. Rubio, Paul Ryan was vocal in his support for giving President Obama   authority and the   Partnership (TPP).   allows international trade deals like TPP to be pushed through Congress without having to face Senate filibusters, treaty votes, or amendments. Rubio even called the TPP a “pillar” of his Presidency. As Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Ryan was essential to Congress’ passage of  . At the time, Politico described passing   as “the fight of Paul Ryan’s career” —  one which, like his push for Obama and Rubio’s immigration agenda, at times had to be conducted “quite stealthily”. Politico writes, “Over the past several months, the Wisconsin Republican has worked  —   almost   and quite stealthily —   to build support to give Obama additional authority to negotiate a massive trade deal with Pacific Rim nations. ” As CNN’s Dana Bash similarly reported in a piece entitled, “Paul Ryan’s New Partner: Obama”: If things had gone differently in the 2012 presidential election, Paul Ryan would be vice president right now. Instead, he’s allied with the President he tried to defeat. As chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, he’s muscling a controversial trade bill through the House that could shape President Barack Obama’s legacy  —   and his own. ” Tonight, Paul Ryan will be seen sitting behind President Obama’s shoulder as the President addresses the nation and articulates his vision for the same trade, crime, and immigration policies shared by Speaker Ryan. The Washington Post recently reported that “Paul Ryan is rapidly emerging as Republicans’  . ” Indeed, the   wing of the Republican Party —  with its emphasis on importing cheaper foreign goods and labor into the country, combined with its unwavering commitment to a doctrine of interventionist foreign policy —  seems diametrically opposed to the Trump wing of the Republican Party, which addresses culture and quality of life issues facing everyday American citizens, such as a immigration, trade, and crime. So far, these issues have yet to come up in any great depth in any of the GOP debates. It will be interesting to see if that changes on Thursday’s debate hosted by FOX Business."
2016-01-13,"Is Hillary Clinton fit to be president of the United States? [Is she physically up to the job of commander in chief?  How’s her health? Those questions may sound as if they’re coming from one of Hillary’s political opponents. But you don’t have to be a     conservative to inquire into the state of Hillary’s health. Everyone —  liberals and independents alike —  should be interested in uncovering the truth. After all, Hillary is a    woman who suffered a fainting spell, a serious concussion and a blood clot on her brain while she was secretary of state. Her husband, Bill Clinton, revealed that it took Hillary “six months of very serious work” to recuperate from her concussion. A year after doctors discovered the blood clot on her brain, Hillary is still on a blood thinner. Recently, Breitbart News reported that she may be suffering from a   syndrome that “severely impacts her cognitive abilities. ” Given the immense stress and strain of being president, Hillary’s health is an issue that demands a thorough exploration. In my new book, Unlikeable: The Problem With Hillary, I devote five pages to Hillary’s health. As far as I can tell, I was the first journalist to show an interest in this critically important subject. Last July, Hillary’s longtime personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, released a short,   letter that appeared to give Hillary a clean bill of health. “She does not smoke and drinks alcohol occasionally,” Dr. Bardack wrote. “She does not use illicit drugs or tobacco products. She eats a diet rich in lean protein, vegetables and fruits. She exercises regularly, including yoga, swimming, walking and weight training. ” According to Dr. Bardack, Hillary has completely recovered from the fainting spell, concussion and blood clot in her brain that she suffered while she was conducting American foreign policy from the State Department. But Dr. Bardack’s letter was hardly a detailed medical history. And according to several sources, who are close to Bill and Hillary Clinton, the letter wasn’t the full story by a long shot. To this day, Hillary still suffers from many of the troubling symptoms that I wrote about in Unlikeable: blinding headaches, exhaustion, insomnia, and a tremor in her hands. As a precaution against the spectacle of fainting in public, which could easily doom her candidacy, Hillary now travels with a personal physician on all her major campaign trips. There have been several incidents in which she has nearly collapsed. For example, after her   testimony before the Trey Gowdy Benghazi committee, Hillary swooned as she walked to a waiting car. She had to be supported in the arms of her aides and helped into the back seat. Tension headaches continue to plague her and often make it hard for her to maintain her grueling schedule. Her closest aide, Huma Abedin, confessed in an   that Hillary is easily “confused” Huma frequently orders campaign aides to alter Hillary’s schedule at the last moment so the candidate can catch her breath and take out time for naps. This may explain why Hillary is often as much as two hours late for a campaign appearance —  and why she was late in returning from a “bathroom break” during a televised Republican debate in December. “She no longer has the stamina for   campaign days that she was once capable of doing,” said a source close to Hillary. In short, this is not the portrait of a hale and hearty candidate for the White House. It’s time for Hillary Clinton to release her complete medical record so that we can judge if she has what it takes to do the job of president."

If Obama had ruled from the center, dealt with the debt, addressed radical Islamic terrorism, dropped the politically correct euphemisms, and pushed tax and entitlement reform rather than Obamacare, Trump might have little traction. A boring Hillary Clinton and a staid Jeb Bush would likely be replaying the 1992 election between Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush  —   with Trump as a   version of   outsider Ross Perot. RELATED: Obama’s Weakness Fuels the Demand for Trump’s Strength, Little is more loathed by a majority of Americans than sanctimonious PC gobbledygook and its disciples in the media. And Trump claims to be PC’s symbolic antithesis. Making Machiavellian Mexico pay for a border fence or ejecting rude and interrupting Univision anchor Jorge Ramos from a press conference is no more absurd than allowing more than 300 sanctuary cities to ignore federal law by sheltering undocumented immigrants. Is it sober and judicious of the Obama administration to ignore immigration laws and effectively open the southern border wide to all comers? RELATED: PC Suppression of Public Concerns Fuels the Trump Phenomenon, Putting a hold on the immigration of Middle Eastern refugees is no more illiberal than welcoming into American communities tens of thousands of unvetted foreign nationals from   Syria. Would the Obama administration allow a mass entrance of persecuted Middle East Christians or displaced Ukrainians? In terms of messaging, is Trump’s crude bombast any more radical than Obama’s teleprompted scripts? Trump’s ridiculous view of Russian president Vladimir Putin as a sort of Art of the Deal geostrategic partner is no more silly than Obama insulting Putin as Russia gobbles up former Soviet republics with impunity. Trump’s confusions are reminiscent of Obama’s own, though Trump knows how to pronounce the word “corpsman,” and that there are not 57 states.

Certainly, Obama peddled a slogan, “hope and change,” that was as empty as Trump’s “make America great again. ” Two, the Republican establishment also jolted Trump to life. Trump supporters apparently don’t believe that Chamber of Commerce, Wall Street, or Republican party grandees offer many antidotes to Obamaism.

Three, Trump is a nihilist, but he is a canny nihilist unlike any we have seen in recent campaigns. In about a day, Trump wrecked Hillary Clinton’s planned “war on women” talking points that had helped to win the election for Obama in 2012. Given the   recognition of microaggressions and the implosion of onetime national icon Bill Cosby, a   feminist warrior like Mrs. Clinton cannot get away with enabling her husband Bill Clinton, a philanderer and accused sexual harasser. “If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women’s card on me, she’s wrong,” Trump declared recently.

2016-01-15,"Flint, Mich. has been poisoning its residents. The city, in an attempt to save money, planned to stop buying water from Detroit and sign up with a regional water system in the interim, it was getting its municipal water from the Flint River, which is as much a garbage dump as it is a body of water. Residents complained that the water smells of chemicals, that it isn’t the right color, etc. Children’s lead levels are dangerously high, and an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease may also be linked to city water. The city knew about this, and did approximately nothing in response until the problem was well advanced. Flint, like big brother Detroit down the way, has a long history of political dominance by the Democratic party. Its current mayor is a Democrat so was her predecessor the mayor before him, Don Williamson, was a career criminal (he did time for various scams some years back) and a Democrat who resigned under threat of recall his immediate predecessor, Democrat James W. Rutherford, is a longtime politico and was elected to finish out the term of Woodrow Stanley, who was recalled because of the financial state in which he left the city. RELATED: The Left’s Burning Cities, The Obama administration knew about this, too, and had known for a long time, since February of last year at least  —   but it chose to keep quiet on the matter. A couple of hundred miles away, a federal judge has found that city lawyers in Chicago  —   which is effectively under   Democratic rule and long has been  —   intentionally concealed evidence during a trial over a police shooting. Chicago’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel  —   former   man to Barack Obama  —   says that it simply is “not possible” that his administration has been involved in a   of possible police misconduct. The evidence involved recordings of police radio communications  —   the sort of thing that would be relevant in a trial about the correctness of a police shooting. The city lawyers also “misled the court” about their evaluation of evidence. Down in Atlanta, the   school system was so thoroughly corrupt that teachers and administrators have been sent to prison a Fulton County judge later reduced some of those sentences, saying he was “not comfortable” with them. In California, the   teachers’ unions went to the mattresses to fight a state law that would have made it easier to fire teachers who had sexual relations with children in their care. When a Los Angeles teacher accused of sexual impropriety with his students was fired, he sued to appeal his firing  —   and the   school district paid him $40, 000 to drop the appeal.

Government already sets the rules under which incumbents can be challenged increasingly, it seeks to set the rules under which incumbents can be criticized, which is what Harry Reid’s jihad against the First Amendment is all about. Because of the nature of government  —   violent and monopolistic  —   the philosophy of big government is always the philosophy of small citizens, and small citizenship. A healthy society has many competing centers of power: governments (federal, state, and local in the U. S. model) businesses, civil society, churches, political parties, interest groups, professional associations, unions, etc. In an unhealthy society, government becomes a kind of cancer, metastasizing into every nook and cranny of society.

We see that at the federal level, too: From the weaponization of the IRS to the neglect of the VA hospitals, nobody ever loses his job, because nobody ever is responsible. The second line of defense is lying and deceiving: In Chicago, that means illegally withholding evidence from a   trial in Sweden, that means misleading the public about how frequently rape is committed, and by whom. In Greece, it means lying about the state of public finances. We have a special problem in the United States, which is that the Democratic party is more of a crime syndicate than a political party, and it is deeply embedded in institutions ranging from the universities (where manufactured hate crimes and phony rape cases are used as political weapons) to the prosecutors’ offices (which bully   personnel and file specious felony charges against politicians for such ordinary actions as vetoing legislation) to the unions (see California) and the schools. It doesn’t matter how many laws Hillary Rodham Clinton breaks, or how often she lies about it  —   the attorney general is a Democrat, and that’s that. Tom DeLay can be brought up on felony charges for allegedly having broken a law that wasn’t even on the books at the time he was said to have broken it (the case was eventually laughed out of court, after it had ended his political career, which was the point) but IRS criminal conspirator Lois Lerner is going to spend the rest of her days enjoying a fat pension at your expense.

2016-01-17,"     The daring attempt by billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX to land the first stage of an umanned rocket on a floating platform in the Pacific Ocean came close but ultimately fell short when one of the landing legs didn’t operate correctly, the company said Sunday afternoon. The launch of the Falcon 9 rocket, on a mission to deliver a government satellite to orbit, was successful. But while the booster stage hit the platform softly, it fell over when one of the landing legs didn’t lock in place correctly, the company said. The attempt to land at sea came a month after the space company landed the first stage of its rocket on a landing pad at Cape Canaveral. [SpaceX returns to flight and pulls off dramatic, historic landing] The rocked lifted off at 1:42 p. m. Eastern time from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and it successfully delivered into orbit a government satellite that would monitor sea levels. But many were watching the event for what would happen after liftoff. Once it powered the rocket into space, the booster stage of the Falcon 9 rocket separated, turned around and headed back toward Earth, using its engine thrust to slow down, just as it did last month. But this time, the rocket aimed for what Musk calls an “autonomous spaceport drone ship,” a platform 200 miles off the California coast that is about the size of a football field.   Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won’t be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. pic. twitter.   —   Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 17, 2016  “Unfortunately, we are not standing upright on the drone ship at the moment,” said John Federspiel, a SpaceX engineer who served as broadcaster during a live Web broadcast. But he said the rocket did hit the target, albeit too hard. Before the launch, a company official on the broadcast said that there were   to   waves, which would make the landing “dicey,” and that it is “a lot more challenging to land on a moving sea platform” than on land.

Typically, the rocket first stages, the most expensive part of the rocket, are discarded into the ocean after each flight. Being able to land and reuse them could, Musk and others think, make space flight much more affordable. SpaceX took a significant step in that direction when it landed its rocket last month. On Friday evening, it successfully   the engines of that rocket, which showed that they could perform again  —   though Musk has said that he intends to preserve the first stage as a historic artifact instead of flying it again. “Conducted   firing of returned Falcon rocket,” Musk tweeted Friday. “Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations. ” Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon. com and owner of a space company, tweeted a congratulations to SpaceX in what appeared to be a peace offering between the two    .

Then, when Musk pulled off the landing at Cape Canaveral last month, Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, appeared to needle him, saying on Twitter that Blue Origin was first: ”Congrats @SpaceX on landing Falcon’s suborbital booster stage.

The company is developing a Falcon Heavy rocket, which would be bigger and more powerful than the Falcon 9. Company officials also said that while it is building a landing site at Vandenberg, it had not yet secured the environmental approvals to attempt landings there. Last year, SpaceX tried twice to land on the drone ship. In both attempts, the rockets hit the platform, but they came down too hard or at a slight angle, tipped over and exploded.

2016-01-18," Ted Wade hasn’t cared about politics enough to cast a vote in a U. S. presidential election for almost a quarter of a century, back when he supported Ross Perot’s independent candidacy in 1992. But Republican Donald Trump’s 2016 White House bid has motivated Wade to get involved and he plans to support the real estate mogul in Nevada’s nominating caucus next month. Trump is a ” ” who can fix the ”chaos” in Washington, he says. About one in 10 Americans who plan to cast a vote this election will do so for the first time in years, if ever, and Trump holds a decided edge with them, according to polling by  . ( ) These voters offer Trump a pool of voters who could be decisive either in the Republican primaries or a general election. They could be crucial for Trump in   states such as Iowa and South Carolina, where his nearest rival, Senator Ted Cruz, is putting pressure on Trump and enjoys a strong base of support with more traditionally conservative voters. In   polling from June to December 2015, 27. 3 percent of these “new” voters said they would vote for Trump, higher than his poll numbers among independents and Republicans who regularly vote. By way of comparison, Cruz captures just 3. 4 percent of these voters. And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida snags only 4 percent. “I’m tired of the chaos between Democrats and Republicans and want to give somebody a try who I think can make a difference,” said Wade of Trump. The    has already switched his affiliation from Democrat to Republican and even attended a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas. He has told his three older children to get involved in the elections, although he did not say whether he wanted them to vote for Trump.  Trump, the Republican   has made targeting “lost” voters such as Wade a focus of his campaign. His   rhetoric and protectionist trade proposals have helped him to fashion a message tailored to reach Americans alienated by the endless enmity between the political parties and who, because of declining economic prospects, may feel like neither party has done much for them. Trump’s strategy is a gamble, given the lack of reliability of many of the voters with whom he is most popular. In interviews, some of those lost voters insist they will show up, saying they are drawn to Trump’s outsider status and his willingness to upend the political system. PAGING A PIRANHA Tucson, Arizona, resident Renay Cunningham, 56, said she had never paid much attention to politics in the past. She plans to cast her first ever vote for Trump after hearing his proposed policies to curb illegal immigration, which include building a giant wall on the southern border and making Mexico pay for it. “We need a piranha in there, and he’s definitely a piranha,” she said. Trump and his operatives are confident they can do what few of his rivals for the Republican nomination have shown they can do  —   expand the party’s potential voter pool. But while Democrat Barack Obama did that eight years ago by largely registering new voters, including record levels of minorities, both male and female, in urban centers, Trump’s campaign has instead largely sought out the disaffected, who tend to be overwhelmingly older, white, and less educated than the broader electorate. “My whole campaign has been focused on expanding the number of people who want to, and will, participate in this election cycle,” Trump wrote in a recent   in USA Today. When analyzing “lost” or “new” voters, Reuters compiled poll results from people who haven’t voted in the previous two presidential campaigns and midterm congressional elections. The results focused only on those who said they were nearly certain to vote in the November election. It included responses from 3, 440 “new” Republican and independent voters  —   a sample that has a credibility interval of 2 percentage points. Jan Leighley, an expert on turnout at American University, said it’s too soon to compare Trump’s “new” voters with the disenfranchised voters, especially minorities, who in 2008 turned out in record numbers to elect the first black president. Those voters didn’t find their way to the polls simply because they were inspired to make history, Leighley said. “He also had a   mobilization structure.” “Obama’s campaign went   . They canvassed whole neighborhoods. “I don’t know if he (Trump) has the campaign infrastructure to make sure that the folks who are riled up are walked to the polls on Election Day,” she said. CHANGING THE RULES Trump’s campaign insists he does have the infrastructure, but won’t provide specifics on how it intends to turn casual supporters into engaged voters. The campaign says it does follow up with the thousands of attendees who jam arenas for Trump’s rallies. That’s one significant advantage the reality star has over the other candidates in the Republican field, as the challenge in reaching voters who have fallen out of the political process often lies in simply locating them. “We’ve identified a lot of people in early primary states who have not participated in the process before,” campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters. Lewandowski resists the notion that Trump needs to turn out “new” or reluctant voters to win states such as Iowa. Even if the Trump campaign isn’t necessarily counting on them, it may be reassuring that his supporters among “new” voters who responded to the   survey appear motivated to cast a vote for him. At least for the time being. Ronald Thomas, a    truck driver and Navy veteran in North Carolina, said he, too, has never voted in a presidential contest. His girlfriend would push him to vote but he would always say ”Yeah, but the right one ain’t come along yet,’” Thomas said. Trump is that man. His willingness to take on the government has set him apart as someone who would ”actually look out for the people,” said Thomas. Now he wants to know how to register so that he can vote for the billionaire.  And there’s Vince DiSylvester, a retired maintenance worker in Missouri, who, at 73, said has never cast a ballot for president. But Trump has inspired him to rethink that. ”He’s a businessman, he knows business, he knows how to get things done,” he said. ”And he tells it like it is. If you don’t like it   well, too bad.”  (Editing by Ross Colvin) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency. * Rising output from key producers may hamper rebalancing   LONDON Wanna buy into one of the hottest commodities in town?

2016-01-19,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of Hugh Hewitt’s radio show, Washington Post columnist George Will discussed the prospects of a contest between Republican presidential   Donald Trump and Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.  Will speculated that a good number of Democrats would cross over and vote for Trump on the Republican side. However, he said that without a “real conservative candidate” in the field, it may inspire a movement for a   candidate. Partial transcript as follows: HEWITT: So, George Will, we got two minutes, so expound on this for me. Donald Trump is a learning machine. I watched him at Liberty University, I watched him in New Hampshire with Scott Brown the day before, he was incredibly gracious to a disabled woman. He is getting better and better at this. And Steve Schmidt thinks he’s going to be the nominee. If he is the nominee, how many Democrats cross over to vote for him and how many Republicans cross over to vote for her if she is indicted? WILL: There would large numbers going both ways. It would be a very interesting migration. I think you would probably have more Democrats going to the Republicans than Republicans going the Democrats but you would also figure that there would be movement to have a   candidate because if the election is Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump, this will be the first election since God knows when, there was no real conservative candidate. And I don’t those of us who have started our political careers, and I cast my vote for Barry Goldwater who valued that classic, creative defeat of his because he took the Republican Party and said henceforth it will be a conservative party. For those of us who feel that way are not about to sit idly and see the Republican Party, which was saved by William Howard Taft in 1912 for conservatism that was reclaimed by Barry Goldwater for conservatism, we’re not going to let it disappear in 2016.

2016-01-20," The opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic has led to a record number of deadly drug overdoses, with the US recording an   high of 52, 000 overdose deaths  —   almost   of which were    —   in 2015. In states like New Hampshire, the crisis is so bad that it’s overtaken the economy and national security as voters’ top concern.    But as awareness of the crisis grows, one of the more exotic policy ideas for dealing with the epidemic has gotten relatively little attention: legalizing medical marijuana. The idea: Medical marijuana is an effective painkiller, so it can substitute some opioid painkillers that have led to the current overdose epidemic. And since marijuana doesn’t cause deadly overdoses and is less addictive than opioids, replacing some use of opioids with pot could prevent some overdose deaths. But this isn’t just a theory. A growing body of research has supported the idea. It’s not definitive research by any means. But with so many Americans dying from opioid overdoses each year, it certainly merits consideration by lawmakers who want to keep medical marijuana illegal at the federal and state levels.    Medical marijuana is an effective painkiller            To understand the opioid epidemic, it’s crucial to understand that America has a pain problem. According to a 2011 report from the Institute of Medicine, about 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain (such as lifelong back pain) more suffer only from acute pain (such as a temporary injury) and many of these cases go untreated. These are the kinds of figures doctors were worried about in the 1990s and 2000s when they began prescribing opioids at record numbers  —   by 2012, enough to give a bottle of pills to every adult in the country  —   and essentially caused the opioid epidemic.    Doctors generally did this with good intentions: They were misleadingly told by drug companies that opioids were both effective and had a lower risk of abuse than other painkillers on the market. So they thought they finally had their way to treat the US’s pain problem without leading to addiction and overdoses. Physicians were obviously wrong to believe that about opioids, and drug companies were wrong to mislead them. But the general point is they were trying to address a serious medical problem to the best of their abilities  —   a problem that remains to this day. The fact that opioids are now reviled as a result of the epidemic doesn’t remove the underlying issue that tens of millions of Americans suffer from debilitating pain and doctors need a way to address that issue.    Well, medical marijuana appears to offer one way to help deal with America’s pain problem without the risks of opioids. The best review of the research to date on marijuana, published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, looked at more than 10, 000 studies to evaluate pot’s potential benefits and harms. Medical marijuana appears to offer one way to help deal with America’s pain problem without the risks of opioids    The review concluded that there’s ”conclusive evidence” for marijuana as a treatment for chronic pain, as well as multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms and   nausea and vomiting. The review also found ”substantial evidence” linking pot to respiratory problems if smoked, schizophrenia and psychosis, car crashes, lagging social achievement in life, and perhaps   problems  —   but it didn’t find any good evidence that marijuana causes health complications, such as overdose, that can lead to death. So the evidence suggests marijuana is good for treating chronic pain, even if it may come with some nonfatal risks. What about opioids? While there is research that opioids effectively treat acute pain, the evidence on whether opioid painkillers can treat chronic pain is weak at best. Opioids also produce much worse side effects than marijuana. For one, there’s the very real risk of deadly overdose. And there’s the risk of addiction: Not only can patients get addicted to opioid painkillers, but their addiction can, according to other research, lead to the use of heroin, an opioid that is cheaper, more potent, and deadlier than painkillers. Marijuana could substitute opioids as a painkiller without any of these vicious side effects. Of course, pot wouldn’t work for everyone  —   just as the effectiveness of medications for other types of health issues can vary from patient to patient. But it could possibly replace some opioid use, and that would prevent some opioid deaths. That’s not entirely hypothetical. A growing body of research shows that legalizing medical marijuana really does reduce the number of opioid deaths.    Medical marijuana legalization appears to lead to fewer opioid deaths              A 2015 paper from David Powell and Rosalie Pacula of the RAND Corporation and Mireille Jacobson of the University of California Irvine concluded, ”Our findings suggest that providing broader access to medical marijuana may have the potential benefit of reducing abuse of highly addictive painkillers.” The researchers looked at both treatment admissions for opioid pain reliever misuse and   opioid overdose deaths. They found relative decreases in misuse and deaths in states with medical marijuana dispensaries, but they didn’t find decreases in states that allow medical marijuana without dispensaries. So the big factor in reducing misuse and deaths seemed to be not just medical marijuana legalization but also access to medicinal pot through dispensaries. The study also found that legal opioid painkiller distribution didn’t seem to decline in states with pot dispensaries, which, according to researchers, suggests people are replacing illegally obtained opioids with pot. But the overall result is still less misuse and fewer deaths. Pacula and Jacobson’s research isn’t the first to produce these kinds of results. A 2014 study, published in JAMA, found medical marijuana laws reduce opioid overdose deaths, although it was less rigorous than Pacula and Jacobson’s analysis. And a 2016 survey from the University of Michigan found that chronic pain patients who used marijuana reported a 64 percent drop in opioid use. The studies show a correlation, not causation. But given that medical marijuana and opioids can fill such similar roles, there’s good reason to believe there’s some causal connection in the data. So there’s a solid empirical case that legalizing medical marijuana might literally save lives  —   by keeping people off opioids. The research isn’t perfect, but the opioid epidemic needs solutions now             A perfectly valid response to all of this is that the research isn’t settled, and there haven’t even been   clinical trials that support medical marijuana  —   the same type of trials that are typically necessary to get medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration.    It is true that the research on medical marijuana could be more rigorous. The research review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine acknowledged as much, calling for more research into pot’s benefits and harms. There should be more studies and   clinical trials, especially if they can prove good ways to separate pot’s psychoactive effects while keeping its maximum medical benefits  —   as     strains of marijuana purport to do. At the same time, there’s a tremendous sense of urgency to the opioid epidemic. Tens of thousands of Americans are dying from opioid overdoses each year. In 2015, there were a record 52, 000 drug overdose deaths in the US, nearly   of which were   according to federal data.       Medical marijuana would not stop all of these overdoses, but it could help. At the very least, the idea merits consideration as the opioid epidemic calls for more attention. "
2016-01-21," One of the sharpest and clearest points of contrast between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton regards his desire to ”break up” the largest Wall Street banks. According to Sanders, a bank that is too big to fail is too big to exist, a theme he offered as the title of his major legislation on the subject.    But Sanders has gone beyond offering dream legislation to suggest that if he is elected president he will achieve a bank breakup within one year, whether Congress likes it or not. It’s a dramatic claim that, if true, would drastically elevate the stakes of a Democratic primary that is mostly being conducted against the backdrop of a likely Republican majority in the House. The bad news for Sanders (and the good news for Citigroup) is that it’s almost certainly not true. There’s considerable expert skepticism that Sanders could accomplish this through executive action alone, and essentially nobody thinks a commitment to do it within one year is credible. The fact that he would make this promise so casually encapsulates the combination of progressive ambition and sloppiness about details that we also saw from his health care plan. But even if Sanders can’t pull off what he promises, the road he says he’ll travel underscores what’s likely one of the biggest differences with a theoretical President Clinton: who would get appointed to key financial regulatory posts. A Clinton administration would likely offer continuity with Obama’s focus on the stability of the financial system, while a Sanders administration seems likely to feature a considerably tougher approach to enforcement that on its own might lead to a substantial decline in megabanks’ economic and political significance.    Bernie Sanders’s commitment to break up the big banks In a January 5 speech on Wall Street and the economy delivered in New York, Sanders sought to raise the stakes of his disagreement with Clinton over the desirability of breaking up major financial institutions by asserting that he could and would accomplish this through executive action.    Here’s the relevant part of the speech:  Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a ”   Fail” list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout. Within one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under Section 121 of the   Act.  This puts bank bailouts on the table in a way a legislative proposal simply doesn’t. If it’s true, it means Clinton can’t argue to liberals who agree with Sanders on the merits that the whole issue is moot anyway because congressional Republicans won’t go for it. Unfortunately for Sanders, the actual text of Section 121 doesn’t really give his hypothetical administration this power in the way he seems to think.    Experts are deeply skeptical Sanders can do this Rob Blackwell is Washington bureau chief for American Banker, a trade publication for the financial services industry that counts many professionals at smaller regional or community banks among its subscribers. It’s home to hot takes like ”New Ways to Raise Capital for Your Bank” and ”Four Ways to Save the Dying Bank Branch,” along with its newsier stories. Blackwill’s take on Sanders’s plan is that it’s ”cuckoo.” ”There is more likelihood that I will be eaten by a great white shark while eating lunch at my desk,” he writes, ”than of this plan ever being enacted.”    It’s easy to find experts who are sympathetic to Sanders and therefore a lot kinder in their phrasing of this criticism. But it’s difficult to find one who disagrees with Blackwill’s basic point, and the Sanders campaign didn’t get back to me when I asked for a response. The problem is that while   does give a collective of federal regulators the authority to order bank breakups, this process isn’t under Sanders’s direct control:  Section 121 of   requires a vote from the Fed that such institutions pose a ”grave threat to the financial stability of the United States,” and a further vote from   of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. That means Sanders needs four of the seven Fed governors to go along with this plan, and seven of the 10 voting FSOC members to approve it. And that is just not going to happen. For one, the current composition of the Fed board would never embrace such a draconian solution absent proof that these banks are a grave threat to the economy (proof that Sanders hasn’t supplied as of yet). If the current Fed board thought the big banks needed to be broken up, it would be doing so already. Moreover, while Sanders could fill the two current vacant seats on the Fed board, the other five have long terms that extend until 2022 at the earliest. (Janet Yellen’s term as Fed chair expires in 2018, but her term as a governor extends until 2024.) That’s a long time to wait to gather the votes necessary for Sanders to implement his plan. Even if the Fed assented, it would also need the concurrence of five of the following heads of these seven agencies: Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, National Credit Union Administration, and Federal Housing Finance Agency. (The two other votes are an independent insurance expert and the Treasury secretary, the latter of which would presumably not be a problem for Sanders.)  In other words, a breakup in year one is entirely impossible. A separate, but related, question is whether regulators committed to this agenda could get confirmed at all. Executive branch appointments is the big issue missing from the primary Sanders’s campaign has thus far focused on really big legislative ideas that are unlikely to be passed into law by any Congress in the foreseeable future. But when I speak to Clinton’s strongest critics in the labor movement and the world of professional progressive politics, what they bring up are the little things, and especially executive branch appointments.  When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, Democrats had been out of power for 12 years, and he had little interest in bringing back veterans of Jimmy Carter’s administration. He initially staffed an economic team that represented a diverse range of viewpoints. But National Economic Council Chair Robert Rubin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who later went on to become Treasury secretary and then chair of Citigroup, quickly emerged as the most significant voice. Over time, his allies and former subordinates came to dominate economic policy jobs in the Clinton administration.    There was once great hope among the more populist, more   faction of politically connected economists that these ”Rubinites,” as they were called by their detractors, would be overthrown from their dominance of the party’s policymaking, especially if Hillary Clinton did not become the nominee in 2008. Things didn’t work out that way. Seeking seasoned hands to guide the country through a financial crisis, Barack Obama picked Clinton administration veterans Tim Geithner, Larry Summers, and Peter Orszag for his key economic policy roles. It’s generally assumed that a Hillary Clinton administration would exhibit considerable continuity with the Obama administration on economic policy personnel, just as Obama exhibited considerable continuity with Bill Clinton, while a Sanders administration would probably look to a different pool. Indeed, in order to make any progress on his goal of using Section 121 authority to break up banks, Sanders would essentially have to draw his appointees from outside the existing universe of Democratic Party economic policymakers. Unfortunately, both formal and informal debates between Clinton and Sanders haven’t really focused on the question of appointments, even though it seems from a distance that they likely have a big disagreement here. Different regulators could make a big difference  —   if confirmed While appointing enough Federal Reserve Board members to start dismantling big banks would be a labor of years, appointing a different team of financial sector regulators would start making a difference right away. Simply put, while Obama officials deeply believe in the need to regulate the financial system to reduce the likelihood that excessive risk taking will lead to new financial crises, they do not doubt the fundamental legitimacy of Wall Street’s role in American politics, economics, and society. They think the presence of large, multinational financial services firms headquartered in the United States is a source of national strength, as is the existence of a large and deep stock market and other financial trading markets. They think speculative markets in commodities and foreign exchange futures serve a useful purpose for the real economy. They think hedge funds and private equity shops do useful work in financing startups and corporate reorganizations. Many of them have worked for private sector financial companies in the past, and many will do so in the future. They all think the presence of people with private sector experience in the regulatory state helps make the policymaking process  .    Sanders has not focused in great detail on his view of these matters, but he has recently taken to slamming the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street and calling out Rubin by name as an example of its pernicious influence. In contrast to Sanders, Elizabeth Warren really has delved deeply into these issues, offering detailed criticism of Obama’s Securities and Exchange Commission, calling for a ”truth in sentencing” bill for   criminal cases, and, most of all, calling for criminal prosecutions of financial institutions. The upshot of Warren’s critique of Obama is that the administration’s desire for financial stability has led it to be serially soft on financial crime, when what it should be doing is taking every possible opportunity to throw the book at the banks  —   seeing the possible collapse of whole institutions as more of a feature than a bug of a rigorous approach to enforcement. As a template for bank shrinkage, this is in many ways more plausible than Sanders’s explicit proposal, and it’s clearly compatible with his rhetoric and his values. The problem, in practice, is that a Sanders administration will find it challenging to get bank regulators confirmed when he’s explicitly stated his intention to have his appointees use Section 121 to begin dismembering banks. Republicans would be opposed to that, naturally, but so might moderate Democrats, and even the fairly liberal Dems who represent New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. On the other hand, the political context of a universe in which Sanders upsets Clinton for the nomination and then wins a general election would be different enough from what we’ve seen in the past that prognosticating about it is difficult.

2016-01-22,"David Brock, a longtime ally of the Clinton family, told the Associated Press on Thursday that Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’ ( ) latest TV ad showed a disregard for Democratic voters of color. Brock told the AP that he thought Sanders’ new ”America” ad, which uses Simon and Garfunkel’s song of the same name in lieu of spoken words, was focused on white voters. The ad shows Sanders greeting mostly white supporters on the campaign trail, with the crowds’ sizes slowly increasing. Brock characterized the ad as a ”significant slight to the Democratic base.”  ”From this ad it seems black lives don’t matter much to Bernie Sanders,” Brock told the AP. Brock, formerly a conservative journalist, runs numerous super PACs supporting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The Sanders campaign fired back in a statement to the AP, saying Clinton should be ”ashamed” of her association with Brock. ”  years ago it was Brock —  a     extremist —  who tried to destroy Anita Hill, a distinguished   law professor. He later was forced to apologize for his lies about her,” Sanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs told the AP. ”Today, he is lying about Sen. Sanders.” Clinton leads Sanders nationally by a margin of 13. 2 points, according to a Real Clear Politics average. The nominating contests start on Feb. 1 in Iowa."
2016-01-23,"During Watergate, Henry Kissinger’s mordant wit leavened the unpleasantness: “The illegal we do immediately the unconstitutional takes a little longer. ” President Obama often does both simultaneously, using executive authoritarianism to evade the Constitution’s separation of powers and rewrite existing laws. Last week, however, the Supreme Court took a perhaps momentous step toward correcting some of the constitutional vandalism that will be Obama’s most significant legacy. The Court agreed to rule on Obama’s unilateral revision of immigration law. In 2014, however, he expanded the sweep and protections of that program. His executive fiat would have shielded perhaps 4. 5 million   adults with children who are U. S. citizens or lawful residents. His expansion made them eligible to work and receive Social Security retirement and disability benefits, Medicare, the   tax credit, unemployment insurance, driver’s licenses, etc. RELATED: President Obama, Meet the ‘Take Care’ Clause, The Court has asked to be briefed on a matter the administration must be reluctant to address the Justice Department requested that the Court not insert a “constitutional question” into the case. The question the Court will consider is: Did Obama’s action violate the Take Care Clause? Obama has sworn to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution,” which says the president shall “take care that the laws be faithfully executed. ” Josh Blackman, an associate professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston and an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute in Washington, says that only three times has the Court relied on the Take Care Clause to limit executive actions, and the justices have never asked for a briefing on this clause. In their brief, the states argue that “Congress has created a detailed, complex statutory scheme for determining” who qualifies for “lawful presence” in this country. No statute empowers the executive to grant this status to any illegal immigrant it chooses not to deport, let alone to confer “lawful presence” status on a class of many millions. RELATED: Obama’s Legacy Is Executive Abuse, The states say presidents cannot “change an alien’s statutory immigration classification. ” So, Obama is not merely exercising discretion in enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act. He is altering this act so that previously prohibited conduct no longer violates the act. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Executive overreach has been increasing for decades. For example, although the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was for financial institutions, the George W. Bush administration diverted more than $17 billion for auto companies. Obama’s usual justification for his unusually numerous unilateral legislating is that Congress refuses to act on this or that subject. But regarding who qualifies for legal status and for the right to work, Congress has acted with notable specificity. Obama simply wants to grant to millions of people various benefits in violation of Congress’s will as written into law. For seven years, Obama has treated the Take Care Clause as a mild suggestion. He considers it insignificant compared with his virtuous determination to “work around” Congress in order to impose his policies regarding immigration, health care, education, contraception, welfare, gun control, environmentalism, gay rights, unauthorized wars, and other matters.

But I did not make him out for a   liar, mainly because I would think that habitual lying would cause too much cognitive dissonance with his  .

Our Tierney Sneed walks us through the original lie, the holes in the logic of the original lie, the campaign admission that the story was false and now the holes in that admission. Apparently Ted just didn’t realize his family had health insurance. Do you have health insurance? I bet a bunch of you are saying ”yes” and ”no” and ”yes, but I’m afraid I’ll lose it” or ”yes, but it costs too much” or ”yes, but Obamacare blows” and a million other things. But, ”you know, Josh, not really sure if I have health insurance or not” is I bet something no one is saying. And this is from the guy who wants us to believe he didn’t realize until he was in his early 40s that he was a Canadian citizen.  I’m sorry. Ted got an Ivy League education at Princeton, went on to Harvard Law School and is by all accounts   including his own   one of the sharpest people around. He’s argued multiple cases before the Supreme Court. It never occurred to him that being born in Canada and lived there until he was four made him a dual citizen? He’s completely ignorant of the most basic elements of nationality law in either country? That doesn’t make sense. Just like it doesn’t make sense that he somehow didn’t realize he had health care coverage. All the holes in his story make this totally obvious: he lied. He just plain made it up because it fit too perfectly with his political message. Josh Marshall is editor and publisher of TalkingPointsMemo. com. "

(NPR’s own Asma Khalid will have her own    analysis coming out soon.) Pros, People generally have two big criticisms of Iowa’s     status (and New Hampshire’s, as well): (1) that the states are not representative of the rest of the country, and (2) that they’re too tiny. Were a state like California or Texas or Florida or New York first, a much bigger share of the U. S. population would get a shot at shaping the presidential race early. And with any of those states (and plenty of others) you get more diversity Iowa and New Hampshire are two of the whitest states in the country, as well as two of the most rural. Cons, Iowa’s smallness is in some ways a feature, not a bug, in that it allows less well funded candidates a fair shot (see: Rick Santorum, 2012, and Mike Huckabee, 2008). The state’s caucus ”ensures that there is at least one place where a candidate with a compelling message has a shot at winning, regardless of money or national fame,” as the Des Moines Register’s Kathy O’Bradovich argued in October. There’s also more to being representative than race and ethnicity. A 2009 paper by the University of Iowa’s Michael   and Missouri’s Peverill Squire found that Iowa was the most representative state economically at the time, as well as relatively representative (12th out of 50 states) when a broad range of social, demographic and economic factors were included. In addition, simply picking a new state wouldn’t solve all of the problems with the current system. In 2008, the scramble to hold early caucuses and primaries led to a massively   calendar. Scrambling the states into a new order wouldn’t have stopped that struggle from happening. The gist, Let people nationwide cast their primary ballots all at once. Who has promoted it, Rep. Richard Hobson in 1911 and a lot more people since then. Well over 100 bills and resolutions have been introduced in Congress since then to try to create a national primary. Pros, A national primary would eliminate worries about one or two states having outsize sway by virtue of voting super early. Not only that, but it would make a complicated calendar way less complex and stop the constant shifting of dates. And by eliminating a bunch of confusion, it might make primaries ”more accessible to the average voter,” which could in turn make for ”more moderate candidates who are more representative of their constituents,” as Pacific Standard’s Shanna   wrote in 2014. Cons, It would make money and name recognition even more important than they already are. Instead of having to focus early on buying ads in Iowa (or whichever state might otherwise go first) a candidate would have a whole nation of media markets to try to hit. That means a less well funded candidate who currently can stand a chance in the small early states right now would be at a huge disadvantage. It could also disadvantage a    candidate like Bernie Sanders. The Vermont independent leads or is closely matched with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the two early states of Iowa and New Hampshire this year, but he trails by double digits in most national polls. In addition, this kind of plan could mean that candidates would focus only on the   states, leaving smaller and largely rural states without many cities  —   and therefore fewer delegates  —   all but abandoned. That’s what Alabama’s   of State Beth Chapman wrote at U. S. News in 2012. The gist, Don’t want to give a couple of states all the   power, every single election? A rotating regional primary would break up the U. S. into a few segments and let each take a turn going first. Under perhaps the   rotating primary plan, put forward by the National Association of Secretaries of State in 2008, there would be four regions (East, Midwest, South and West) with each taking one primary slot (in March, April, May or June). The order of regions would then rotate in each election cycle. Who has promoted it, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, the National Association of Secretaries of State, the National Lieutenant Governors Association and plenty of others. Pros, A scheduled system like this would get rid of the   that led to a superearly nominating season in 2008. This is the first reason that the secretaries of state association gave in its 2008 proposal, pointing out that 37 states voted before Feb. 29 that year, while only nine did so in 2000. It also could give voters more time to get to know the candidates and give more informed votes, not to mention potentially giving more voters a say in who eventually gets nominated, the group argued. Finally, it could make campaigning more efficient  —   no longer would candidates have to hop from Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina for a few months. And as the University of Arizona’s Barbara Norrander has argued, it would make campaign ads more efficient. (Consider the   Minnesotans and Illinoisans currently being subjected to Iowa’s campaign ads). Cons, Here’s one weird twist: The secretaries of state proposal still puts Iowa and New Hampshire first, ”based upon their tradition of promoting retail politics.” That defeats the purpose of reforming the system to some degree, keeping those two demographically unrepresentative states at the front of the calendar. But leaving that aside, there are other potential problems with rotating regional primaries. While the plan seeks to equalize states’ participation in primaries, whichever region goes last in any given cycle runs the risk of being meaningless it’s possible the winners will already be apparent by the time the final contest rolls around. Certain candidates would also probably benefit more in any given election based on which region goes first, as political scientists Steven Smith and Melanie Springer wrote in 2009. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for example, could potentially benefit far more if this primary season started with South, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could get a big initial boost from a Northeastern primary. Not only that, but knowing that her or his region would be first in the next election, a strong candidate in one region could ”block out a strong candidate from another region,” as former Ohio GOP Chairman Bob Bennett argued. And maybe taking things a few states at a time isn’t such a bad idea, argues Norrander. ”Most would agree that    meetings between the candidates and real voters are a good component of the current system,” she writes. ”Because of the large size of each region, candidate strategy will consist of television advertising and tarmac campaigning.” The gist, Let the little states go first. The Delaware Plan separates states into four groups, each with 12 or 13 states, as explained by   advocacy group FairVote. Group 1, consisting of the   states and territories, votes first, followed by Group 2 one month later, and so on. Who has promoted it, Most notably, the RNC considered the Delaware Plan in 2000. Pros, The point of the Delaware Plan was to keep the nomination season from growing shorter and shorter, as states fought to go earlier and earlier, as USA Today reported in 2000. That year, the season was so short that   of the states ended up ”without a voice,” the paper reported. The Delaware Plan tries to equalize states: Smaller states naturally have a smaller voice, but they’d get amplified by being earlier. Meanwhile, the powerful larger states’ voices would be turned down a bit by being later. And because a candidate couldn’t win the nomination very early, it would prolong the primary season, giving people longer to learn about the candidate and make their decisions. In addition, it could equalize candidates to some degree  —   candidates with lots of   support could likewise gain ground in the small states and potentially then be able to compete in the bigger states, as FairVote argues. Cons, Smaller states tend to be less urban than the rest of the country, not to mention whiter, as Smith and Springer wrote  —   meaning this plan wouldn’t exactly solve the issue of early states not being representative. They also add that starting with 12 states that aren’t geographically grouped would create some   campaigns, as opposed to the way that a regional plan might make campaigning easier. In addition, starting off with so many states at once could still favor   candidates, Norrander points out. The gist  This is a sort of compromise between the Delaware Plan and the rotating regional plan. The Ohio Plan would have let four current early states (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada) go first, followed by a group of 15 small states and territories. After that, three bigger groups of states would take turns holding their primaries. Each of those groups would have had at least one   ”anchor state,” as Brookings’ Elaine Kamarck explains. Who has promoted it, The Ohio Plan was proposed by Bob Bennett, the   of the Ohio GOP, before the 2008 election. Pros, Bennett argued that his plan would be more acceptable to big states than the Delaware Plan while maintaining the kind of retail politics influence that small states  —   and the current early states  —   allow. In addition, keeping South Carolina and Nevada early would add more diversity early in the process than the Delaware Plan. Cons, The plan would still maintain some of the cons of the secretaries of states’ and Delaware plans  —   despite the early participation of South Carolina and Nevada, there are still a lot of very white states with early influence. In addition, candidates would have to hit a lot of geographically   states at once. The gist, It’s a little like the Delaware Plan in the sense that smaller states would go first. However, it’s way more complicated. So here goes: There would be 10 caucus periods, each lasting two weeks. States with fewer congressional districts would go first, followed by states with a few more in the next period and so on. This would be according to a particular formula: States with a total of eight districts would go first, with the states being randomly selected. So, for example, Kansas and Mississippi, which each have four districts, might be in the first round. The next round, the number of districts would total 16. The next, 24. But after that, the numbers get less straightforward. To keep the biggest states like New York and California from always going nearly last, the plan allows for some bigger district totals to go earlier. The order for all 10 caucus rounds would be eight, 16, 24, 56, 32, 64, 40, 72, 48 and then 80 districts, according to FairVote. Who has promoted it, The Democratic National Committee considered it in 2005, and FairVote has advocated for it as well. Pros, It maintains many of the benefits of the Delaware Plan, potentially making the primary season longer (and therefore, potentially more informative) and giving more states the opportunity to have a say  —   all without leaving all the biggest states for last. Cons, Once again, there’s the potential for some really inefficient campaigning. Imagine candidates having to hop from Alaska to Idaho to West Virginia to Rhode Island for the first round of caucuses. That could give   candidates a leg up. Also, it’s complicated  —   but compared with what? As Smith and Springer wrote, the American Plan ”surely would be no more complicated than the current schedule.”"
2016-01-27,"’ There are lots of affluent young people on Facebook’ ’ And they’re very, very scared of debt.’ ’ And young people  —   even the affluent ones  —   really don’t like credit cards.’ ’ Lots of young people (on Facebook at least) save, but not necessarily towards a financial goal.’ ’ But just because many young people are putting money away, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re investing.’ ’ Young women talk more often about financial issues on Facebook.’ ’ And hashtags, lots of hashtags. ’] Researchers at the social network have put together a white paper on the topic using survey data, the company’s own Audience Insights tool, and analysis of conversations and content on Facebook itself. The study was done to help “financial services marketers understand what millennials on Facebook talk and care about,” Facebook’s Financial Services Head of Industry Jerry Canning said. Young Facebook users tend to be “  of new technology and are driving the changes that are shaping the future of banking,” Canning said. From Venmo to Robinhood, Wealthfront, and Affirm, there are a bevy of   financial services apps that offer everything from investment advice to money transfers, with a   spin. They’re all marketed to young people, and some of them are big advertisers on Facebook.  Even Facebook Messenger offers    payments (all of Facebook’s messaging products are run by David Marcus, who prior to joining the social network was the president of PayPal, the most successful financial company of the last tech boom). Here’s what Facebook’s study had to say about young people and money: While the type of financial services you might see advertised during a football game promote the idea of using a company’s financial prowess to build up assets and retire rich, Facebook found only 18% of young people agreed that “being able to retire is the #1 indicator of financial success. ” Meanwhile, 46% said “financial success means being debt free. ” A quarter of young people agreed that credit cards “worsen my financial standing,” a feeling they are 1. 3 times more likely to express than older people.  The young people who do think more positively about credit cards tend to do so in strategic terms. “  percent of millennials say the main reason they use credit cards is to help them build credit and 36% to increase their financial flexibility,” the white paper says. For young people, it’s a bit different, Facebook’s data shows.   percent of young people save some money, the survey said, but only 17% say the main reason they are saving is to buy a home. Retirement feels like a   fantasy at this point, with only 8% citing it as the primary reason they are saving.    percent of young people say they are saving “because they want to ‘be responsible,’” a motivation that’s 2. 7 times more common among young people than baby boomers. Young people are 2. 5 times more likely to trust automated investment strategies, Facebook’s data shows. But, for now, the young people these tech companies target are less likely to invest at all, according to Facebooks’s data. They’re 1. 6 times more likely than older generations to have no investments at all. The reason being, for the majority (54%): “they don’t feel they have the money” to be investing. About a quarter say they don’t invest because “they don’t know enough about investing. ”  "

2016-01-29," Anyone who’s gone through it knows that you never come out just once. There are the bigger moments  —   coming out to your parents, maybe, or to best friends or classmates or    —   but there are the quotidian ones, too. A lesbian lets her gynecologist know why she doesn’t need any birth control right now, thanks but no thanks. A bisexual man, swallowing his horror, tells a presumptive waiter that the guy he’s sharing some fried calamari with is his boyfriend, not his brother. A nonbinary pansexual person dating a cisgender guy explains a million times over that even if their relationship looks straight from the outside, they’re actually super fucking queer. Just as often as LGBT people slog through these little everyday   however, many choose certain moments to remain quietly, but assuredly, in. We decide to let our landlords assume our partners are just roommates. We don’t disclose our gender identity or our sexual orientation at a bar when being heckled by an aggressive drunk. We let grandmothers and bosses and pastors assume we’re something we are not, out of love or a simple desire to keep the peace, or to assure our safety. Coming out is LGBT 101 at this point. There couldn’t be a more boring question than “When did you come out?” or “When did you know?”  —   yet queer people are asked both constantly. These questions are, of course, dumb and reductive, because no one could possibly offer a single   answer: Out versus In is not a binary, but a lifelong series of strange and shifting negotiations. Though Ellen’s “Yep, I’m gay” cover may always be the   of all   an enormous and explicit public declaration has never been the extent of the practice for celebs or us normals. The supposed closets in which many of us crouched as children (and beyond) are not fixed and finite, nor or they identical for everyone. For some  —   butch dykes,   femmes  —   the closet was never really there at all. It’s an overused and radically unhelpful metaphor. And yet Coming Out still remains broadly defined in the way it was for Ellen, and long before her: as a status, spoken. As a before and after. Charlie Carver, the Teen Wolf actor who publicly came out last week on Instagram, summed it up in a tweet: “I am one of a community that has to announce itself to be known. ” But now  —   as more people are embracing the concept of sexual fluidity, some even refusing to label their orientations at all  —   is that announcement really still necessary? In a heteronormative world full of people who assume that everyone is straight and cisgender unless a bomb of queer signifiers blows up in their face, public declarations remain the only surefire way to convey queerness to a vast number of people. Carver has been one of a number of young stars to publicly announce their sexual orientation on social media in the last few weeks. His message was spread over five Instagram posts of the same image: a sign reading “Be who you needed when you were younger. ” Two weeks ago, the brilliant    actor Amandla Stenberg took over Teen Vogue’s Snapchat to advocate for a world in which everyone sees themselves reflected in the media, sharing that she identifies “as a black, bisexual woman. ” Colton Haynes, an actor on Arrow (as well as Teen Wolf, alongside Charlie Carver) wrote an extremely ambiguous response on his Tumblr to a post referencing his “secret gay past. ” “Was it a secret?” he wrote. “Let’s all just enjoy life  have no regrets :)” It definitely wasn’t a   but it wasn’t quite a denial, either. While splashy cover stories used to be a popular option for famous gays ready to take the   plunge  —   from Ellen’s Time cover in 1997 to Lance Bass’s People cover in 2006  —   messages spread through a celebrity’s own social media platforms demonstrate the growing irrelevance of major media when it comes to celebs’ personal announcements, a trend John Herrman thoroughly documented in The Awl last month. While     still do happen  —   Olympic skier Gus Kenworthy revealed that he identifies as gay in ESPN The Magazine last October, and Caitlyn Jenner’s highly contentious Vanity Fair cover will likely go down in history as the most famous iteration of the genre  —   covers look stodgy and conventional when celebs can now reach teens without the filters of publishers and PR people between them. Snapchat feels friendly and intimate a magazine cover is a publicity statement. But among celebrities announcing their queerness, whether ostentatiously in Big Media or through chiller routes like tweets or ’grams, there are plenty who eschew official admissions altogether. On the Death, Sex  Money podcast last December, actor Holland Taylor told host Anna Sale: “I haven’t come out because I am out. I live out. ” The concurrent news that she’s dating fellow actor Sarah Paulson boggled the minds of many, even though both women had been publicly affectionate IRL and on social media for months. Taylor’s    recalled Jodi Foster’s famously confusing speech at the 2013 Golden Globes, as well as Kristen Stewart’s August cover story in Nylon, throughout which the interviewer was clearly fishing for some sort of sexuality pronouncement. “I don’t feel like it would be true for me to be like, ‘I’m coming out! ’” Stewart said, as well as: “Google me. I’m not hiding. ” And she wasn’t. At least by then. All summer, Stewart was constantly photographed by the paparazzi holding hands with her   girlfriend at the time, Alicia Cargile. But, as my very smart colleague Kate Aurthur wrote in an essay last June, “when [Stewart] started dating a woman, it was as if she had suddenly become invisible. ” All photographic evidence of intimacy to the contrary, Stewart and Cargile were labeled “gal pals” and “BFFs” by the same tabloids that had put the minutiae of her dating life with men on blast. Stewart was, as always, incredibly visible in the media  —   much more so than she would like  —   but her rather overt queerness went unnoticed. Queer women, in particular, are constantly assumed to be straight, with their romantic relationships belittled as friendships or phases or performances for horny heterosexual men. While Stewart’s queer cred has been glaringly obvious to lesbians everywhere for years, there are still plenty of clueless straight people out there who  —   not knowing where to look or even to look  —   still think of Stewart as the   of Robert Pattinson and that English film director. Which is not Stewart’s fault, or her responsibility. The onus shouldn’t be on queer people to declare their otherness over and over. Still, in her Nylon interview, Stewart went further than just refusing to come out on someone else’s terms. “If you feel like you really want to define yourself, and you have the ability to articulate those parameters and that in itself defines you, then do it,” she said, adding: “Until I decide that I’m starting a foundation or that I have some perspective or opinion that other people should be receiving  …    I don’t. I’m just a kid making movies. ” It was a rather strange implication  —   that, for her, to come out would mean she was taking up the mantle of queer activism, potentially lumped in with the likes of Ellen Page, whose own   speech in 2014 at an HRC event was undeniably inspired by a social consciousness. Stewart also seemed to think that, were she to give herself a label, it would supersede the one label she does care about (“I am an actress, man”). It’s a fair worry: The further anyone is from being a straight white cisgender man, the more they face pigeonholing in their careers. But those who can avoid   with a marginalized label by blending in with the majority do hold a particular privilege over those who can’t  —   particularly trans women of color, who, in their   are targets for epidemic levels of violence. Stewart’s comments share a certain kind of derision with Cate Blanchett’s at the Cannes Film Festival last May. A Variety cover story quoted Blanchett as having been in past relationships with women “many times,” but Blanchett later claimed the reporter had taken her words out of context. “Sexuality is a private affair,” she told Cannes reporters. “What happens these days is if you are homosexual, you have to talk about it constantly it has to be the only thing you have to put it before your work, before any other aspect of your personality. ” (Stephanie Fairyington shut down this rather ridiculous presumption in Slate: “What Blanchett experiences as homosexuality’s loud   is a faint whisper next to the roar of heterosexuality. ”) And then there was Matt Damon giving some acting advice in The Guardian last September. “Whether you’re straight or gay, people shouldn’t know anything about your sexuality because that’s one of the mysteries that you should be able to play,” he said  —   a curious instruction, since he personally makes no effort to deny the fact that he’s married to a woman. Damon, Blanchett, and Stewart can’t seem to conceive of a world wherein someone can own up to being gay without their gayness taking over every aspect of their personhood and professionalism  —   or at least, without the media assuming as much. After the Nylon interview, Stewart was championed as someone who refuses to publicly label herself. Denouncing labels when it comes to sexual orientation is au courant, for what is probably a conflation of many reasons. The average   age has been radically dropping, and many young people are taking the   time to figure themselves out and explore before closing in on a name for their sexuality, should they ever. Back in August, when      Depp posed for the Self Evident Truths Project, a portrait series of thousands of Americans who identify as “not 100% straight,” the headlines declared she’d come out as such. Last week, Girl Meets World actor Rowan Blanchard tweeted that she’s also joined the No Labels camp, saying that even though she has “only ever liked boys,” she doesn’t want to identify “as straight gay or whateva,” nor does she want to give herself “labels to stick with. ” The    is interested in “just existing. ” For the young and questioning, No   but Straight offers a hallowed space for   in those very confusing early years of sex and dating. But many believe  —   even hope  —   that this trend is much bigger than young people finding themselves. An increasingly popular hypothesis about fluidity and queerness predicts that we’re all hurtling toward a future of sexual fluidity, when all labels will be collapsed into meaninglessness. One such study propagating this theory, out of the University of Essex last November, claimed that “women are either bisexual or gay, but “never straight. ” (It was widely criticized one of the best shakedowns came from Anna Pulley in The Cut, who points out that just because women are biologically turned on by stimuli doesn’t mean their brains are always on the same page.) Another poll, conducted by YouGov in August 2015, used the   Kinsey scale to determine that 1 in 3 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 “plot themselves as something other than exclusively heterosexual. ” Of that same American demographic group, however, 84% identify as heterosexual  —   which means that, presumably, of the 31% who didn’t plot themselves as completely straight, roughly half identify as straight regardless. Rather than repressing queer feelings, it seems as though many young people are opening themselves up to at least the possibility of queer experience. All the more fascinating, then, is that while young people are more open to different kinds of attraction than ever, many who fall somewhere in the middle of the Kinsey scale still call themselves heterosexual  —   which is, of course, a label, like any other. So are “not 100% heterosexual” and “not 100% straight”  —   labels which, even as they try to distance themselves from heterosexuality, manage to center it. A never say never attitude  —   even for “straight” people, especially for “straight” people  —   when it comes to sexuality is undoubtedly a healthy one, particularly because the boundaries of gender are beginning to gloriously crumble around us. Those atrocious videos of lesbians touching penises for the first time, or gay men who try kissing straight women, assume an extremely narrow breadth of not only queer, but human experience  —   there are, in fact, lesbians with penises, just as there are gay men with vaginas. Our labels, as much as we try to hold fast to them, are beginning to strain at the seams, and we’re being forced to interrogate what our queerness means to us. So much the better. In Maggie Nelson’s quietly explosive book, The Argonauts, she grapples with whether or not language can keep up with the way we fuck, the way we live. “There are no longer binary machines:       etc. ,” she writes. “This could be what a conversation is  —   simply the outline of a becoming. ” The call for sexual fluidity’s revolution does sound like an exciting conversation, particularly on the level of individual personal agency  —   why the hell not open yourself up to possibilities you might have once thought closed off to you?  —   but as a social trend, or even as a social prescription, the conversation leads to dead ends. When Rowan Blanchard tweeted that she didn’t want to label herself, many fans tweeted back with confusion. “Open to liking any gender in [the] future is why I identify as queer,” she clarified in a   tweet, seemingly reneging on her pact to stay  . “But have you actually been attracted to more than one gender :  being open to it is not the same,” another fan tweeted back to her. A    girl should by no means feel compelled to predict her whole romantic future  —   and policing other people’s conceptions of their own queerness is, of course, a   game  —   but questioning attraction versus openness draws an interesting distinction nonetheless. In terms of the bigger picture, it’s easy enough for the more cynical among us to feel as though culturally equating a hint of queer possibility with attraction and action could lead to people of any age   queerness for its current cool factor. In 2016, renouncing labels is often hailed as   and cosmopolitan  —   an admirable way to exist above the fray of identity politics  —   whereas, for example, bisexuals and pansexuals who unabashedly label their interest in more than one gender are still stereotyped as greedy, slutty, and indecisive. Encouraging people to explore their sexualities without feeling confined to a label is all well and good (even if it means that a few will end up dubiously claiming queerness along the way) but supporting a future in which we all eschew labels altogether in the name of fluidity is not only futile, but potentially damaging to everyone who has finally felt at home in an identity discovered and claimed. Human sexuality is a big, messy, extraordinary thing, and as our conception of gender identity grows, it’s only going to get messier  —   but invoking the spectrum to indicate that Come on, man, everybody’s just a little fluid, bro, doesn’t do most queers any favors. “What does it matter who you sleep with?” anonymous posters complain in the comments section of yet another   story. “Why is anyone’s sexuality even a big deal anymore? Can’t we all just be people?” Cate Blanchett put it this way, back when she was shutting down the lesbian rumor mill: “In 2015, the point should be: who cares?” It’s a delicious proposition. If we don’t label ourselves, perhaps we won’t be othered and oppressed at long last. But a better question might be (updated for the new year): In 2016, why do we still care? Why do interviewers keep fishing for celebs to out themselves? Why, when famous people we admire give themselves a label and share it with the world, do the news stories written about them still go viral? Maybe because heteronormativity is still such a looming presence that anyone who rejects it  —   even in the simplest, most banal way of public    —   is doing something that’s still rather rare (LGBT people remain, after all, a minority). Maybe because there are plenty of people in this world for whom more   is a danger and a threat. Maybe because anyone who identifies as heterosexual can be opened up to the world of queer possibility when identities like bisexuality are asserted and validated. Maybe because young and questioning kids want to believe they can grow up to be movie stars or titans of industry without having to painstakingly avoid being seen around or even mentioning their significant others, lest they be criticized for shoving their queerness down everyone’s throats  —   or worse, harassed or fired from their jobs. On Twitter, Teen Wolf’s Charlie Carver said that his sexuality “was not a secret to many, but I felt it necessary to share (until coming out is a thing of the past). ” That’s the dream: when famous   will no longer be news when all queers can roam the world openly without having to explain themselves over and over, without having their right to health and happiness violated once they do. But insinuating that people should simply stop doing it, or no longer need to  —   whether on a magazine cover, in a speech, on social media to one person, to a million  —   is not quite the answer. If anything, the more people who claim queerness, the more normalized it will become and the less fanfare it will inspire. That isn’t to say, though, that queer people should have to keep explaining themselves ad nauseum  —   especially because it isn’t always safe. Perhaps there is a happy medium to be reached someday, where casually alluding to one’s own gender identity or sexuality is no big deal, while we simultaneously stop assuming that everyone is straight and cisgender unless they explicitly tell us otherwise. Mentioning a partner of the same gender should be as normal as asking someone for their preferred pronouns. And why not encourage straight and cisgender people to both announce and interrogate their own labels for a change? If LGBT people are still pressed to come out  —   particularly trans and   people, who, when disclosing their identities, risk being vigorously policed, shamed, doubted, and met with unspeakable violence  —   then, until   is no longer the assumed default, so should we all. “How can the words not be good enough?” Nelson writes in The Argonauts. Our words: trans, genderqueer, bisexual, lesbian, gay, pansexual, intersex, nonbinary, asexual, on and on and on, a train of labels which can feel restrictive and limiting one moment and like salvation, like home, the next. They are flawed, powerful, and   words. They are words soaked with the blood and sweat of generations of people who fought, no matter the costs, for our right to claim them. Queer, dyke, fag: words used to assault and humiliate, which we can wear, if we so choose, as a big old “fuck you” to everyone who once weaponized them against us. Are the words enough? Alone, they aren’t. Not even close. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t keep shouting them.   "
2016-01-30,"       TUSCALOOSA, Ala.  —   America’s most prominent public universities were founded to serve the people of their states, but they are enrolling record numbers of students from elsewhere to maximize tuition revenue as state support for higher education withers. The shift has buttressed the finances and reshaped the profile of schools across the country, from the University of California’s famed campuses in Berkeley and Los Angeles to the universities of Arkansas, Oregon, Missouri, South Carolina and numerous other places.   of the 50 schools known as “state flagships” enrolled a smaller share of freshmen from within their states in 2014 than they had a decade earlier, federal data show. At 10 flagships, state residents formed less than half the freshman class. Nowhere is the trend more pronounced than here at the University of Alabama, where students who cheered this month when the Crimson Tide won its fourth national football championship in seven years were mostly from other states. In 2004, 72 percent of new freshmen here were Alabamians. By 2014, the share was 36 percent. That was the largest swing in the country among 100 flagship and other significant state universities The Washington Post analyzed using federal data on student residency. The percentage of   freshmen fell at more than 70 of those schools during that decade. There were declines of 20 or more percentage points at   and UCLA, Idaho State University and the flagships of South Carolina, Missouri, Oregon and Arkansas. There also were drops of more than 15 percentage points at Michigan State, Ohio State, and the universities of Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky and Washington. The overhaul of the student body at   schools reverberates in statehouses and among consumers. “People inside states believe that they have greater access to their state universities,” said Marguerite Roza, a Georgetown University research professor who studies education finance. Many are now asking, she said, “who does that public university belong to anymore? And what is it doing? Is it seeking ‘elite’ status? That’s great, but not if your own kids can’t go there. ” Kendall Roden, 21, of Garland, Tex. said she was lured to Tuscaloosa even though she had been admitted to the more prestigious University of Texas. Alabama offered her a sizable scholarship, and she said she has thrived as a management information systems major. Plus she got to see coach Nick Saban’s team win national titles in her freshman and senior years. Being a football fan, she said, is “a huge part of my life and Alabama’s culture. It’s the lifeblood of the university. ”    Kendall Roden, a University of Alabama senior from Garland, Tex. stands in front of a massive photo of a Crimson Tide football game on a wall of the Ferguson Student Center. Football is “the lifeblood of the university,” she said. (Evelyn   The Washington Post)  On one level, the shift is all about money. Tuition and fees for    students at   public universities average $23, 893, according to the College Board.   students are charged an average of $9, 410. The    premium, 150 percent, is lucrative for schools that draw thousands of non residents. “They pay full freight,” said UCLA Chancellor Gene Block. “They bring in huge amounts of additional revenue. ” That funding is key to maintaining academic excellence, he said. In 2004, 94 percent of UCLA’s freshmen were Californians. Ten years later, the share was 73 percent. The number of Californians entering as freshmen at Westwood remained relatively stable  —   averaging about 4, 100 from 2008 to 2014  —   but the number of non residents surged after the economic recession in 2007 to 2009. There was an    spike at Berkeley, too, creating political problems. Three of every 10 freshmen at the California flagship in 2014 came from out of state, up from 1 in 10 a decade earlier. Gov. Jerry Brown (D)  —   a Berkeley alumnus  —   wondered last year whether “normal” residents from the nation’s   state were getting a fair shot at admission to their top university. University of California President Janet Napolitano, who oversees the system, pledged afterward to limit    enrollment last year in Berkeley and Los Angeles. All of UC’s undergraduate campuses are planning to raise their   totals significantly in the next school year. Block said the   provide a big   benefit: a cosmopolitan atmosphere on a campus with global reach. Several hundred in each class at UCLA and Berkeley are foreigners. “There’s no substitute for international students,” Block said. “They bring perspective you just can’t get from the domestic population. It really does add to the environment for everybody. ” Numerous studies have shown the historic decline of state support for higher education, although several states raised appropriations modestly in recent years. The Delta Cost Project at American Institutes for Research found this month that state and local funding per student at public research universities was 28 percent lower in 2013 than in 2008, after adjusting for inflation.  [Why the price tag of a college degree continues to rise]  The fiscal vise forced universities to trim costs and raise revenue, largely through tuition in creases or additional students.    expansion proved especially crucial for schools in states with stagnant numbers of high school graduates. “The primary driver for us was the demographic reality,” said Roger Thompson, vice president for enrollment management at the University of Oregon. At that flagship, the   share of new freshmen fell from 68 percent in 2004 to 47 percent in 2014. Experts say there is no sign the trend will reverse. “The reliance on non resident tuition income is probably going to continue,” said George Pernsteiner, president of the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. “Even in the states that have seen increases in state support in the last few years  —   have they reduced their non resident enrollment? Well, no. ” Some flagships bucked the trend. At the University of Maryland in College Park, the   share of the freshman class rose from 67 percent in 2004 to 72 percent in 2014. There were similar   increases at the universities of Florida, Georgia and Tennessee. At the University of Virginia, which sets aside about   of freshman seats for state residents, the geographic balance barely changed. Greg W. Roberts, dean of admission at  . said    demand is so high that non resident applicants are admitted at a far lower rate (24 percent) than Virginians (44 percent). Shannon Gundy, undergraduate admissions director at  . said recruiting top    students is difficult. It often requires “spending” money  —   through discounts and scholarships  —   to land students who are shopping for the best deal. “A lot of schools have financial re sources that allow them to entice    students to come, and that’s not something that we’ve done,” Gundy said. “We do offer scholarships for   and    students, but it’s not our intention to go out and grab    students for the sake of having them. We want to make sure we are remaining true to our mission. ” Texas A&M University, one of the nation’s largest, gave 95 percent of its freshman seats to Texans in 2014, the highest   share among schools The Post analyzed. The flagship University of Texas at Austin was not far behind, at 89 percent. Those figures reflect the state’s surging population and the guarantee of admission to the best students from every public high school. “We serve the state,” said Michael K. Young, Texas A&M’s president. “Our demand curve is extremely high for   kids. They are really good, and there are a lot of them. ” But Young said he would like to increase    enrollment a bit, to “enliven perspectives” at College Station through geographic diversity. University of Alabama officials say they, too, serve their state. But they have done it in large part by recruiting outsiders. Demographics and state finances  left them little choice, they said. Alabama’s population has grown at a lower rate than the nation’s, and its output of high school graduates has been up and down. Volatility in state funding for higher education led the flagship in 2003 to launch a major    growth plan, hunting for students in Texas, Georgia, Florida and beyond. Undergrad enrollment shot up more than 90 percent in ensuing years, topping 30, 000 in 2014. “When students vote with their feet to be at your institution, that’s a really great outcome,” said the university’s president, Stuart R. Bell. Geographic diversity benefits students, he said. “Our graduates need to be able to thrive in a very dynamic and flexible world. ” Bell said the flagship, founded in 1831, is not overlooking Alabamians. “We’re serving every student who could come to the university and be successful here,” he said. The transformation in Tuscaloosa is hard to overstate, faculty and administrators say. The manicured greens of the central quad, the Denny Chimes bell tower of brick and limestone, and the core academic halls with columned facades remain as they were in generations past. But a building spree  —   said to entail an opening or renovation every 90 days  —   has enlarged and modernized a campus packed with more students than ever. Faculty, weary of budget cuts before the boom, received substantial raises after it.     Students walk over a footbridge connecting new residential buildings with the older part of the University of Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa. (Evelyn   The Washington Post)     Stuart R. Bell, president of the University of Alabama, is upbeat about the growth in    enrollment at the state’s flagship university. (Evelyn   The Washington Post)    Many students from out of state cite three factors that drew their attention: a winning football tradition, an honors college and merit scholarships. Coach Saban earns $7 million a year, but the value of the marketing boost his team provides the school is immense. The honors college, launched in 2003, has about 6, 000 students. They qualify through high grades and test scores (minimum score of 28 on the ACT or 1250 on SAT reading and math) and they get benefits including seminars capped at 15 students per professor, as well as service and research opportunities. Scholarships often clinch the deal. Alabama spends about $80 million a year on scholarships and grants for students without financial need (not counting athletic scholarships) twice as much as it does on   aid, according to data provided to analysts. Discounts to the    price  —   which total about $35, 000 for tuition, fees, room and board  —   help the school land   normally wooed by more prestigious schools that can cost up to $60, 000 a year. “Really, it was about money and scholarships,” said Henry Poole, 19, a junior math major from San Diego. “I basically decided I didn’t want to spent $200, 000, $300, 000 or however much money. I decided I could make this work. There’s a lot of cool opportunities here. ” Amanda Bennett, 21, a senior in English and African American studies from Atlanta, said she turned down schools from the Ivy League and elsewhere to come here because Alabama offered the most competitive academic scholarship. “I couldn’t have asked for a better deal,” she said. The influx from out of state is helping to reshape the image of a school famous as a scene of civil rights battles. In 1963, Gov. George C. Wallace, an ardent segregationist, made his “stand in the schoolhouse door” at Foster Auditorium to protest the admission of African Americans Vivian Malone and James Hood. In the past decade, the school has grown somewhat more racially diverse: In 2004, 83 percent of undergrads were white; in 2014, the share was 77 percent. Last year, students elected the school’s first African American student government president since the 1970s. Elliot Spillers, 21, a senior in business management from Pelham, Ala. said support from non residents helped propel his victory. “Students here from Chicago, Texas, California  —   they’re changing the culture of this university,” he said. “They have been able to put pressure on this campus and make a difference  —   and change it for the better. ”    Student government President Elliot Spillers is the first African American since the 1970s to hold the post at the University of Alabama. He credited his election in part to support from    students. (Evelyn   The Washington Post)  "
2016-01-31,"It is high time to declare  —   honestly and without exaggeration  —   that the 2016 GOP presidential primary has officially become the greatest, most interesting, most entertaining election of all time! [And it all culminated in Thursday night’s triple header of political imbroglios in Des Moines. The Corn State Three Ring Circus on Ice. Truly, the greatest show on earth!  The opening act was the undercard debate with four trailing Republicans  —   including the two Republicans who won the last two GOP Iowa caucuses! And it was a great fight with plenty of rage and vehemence. Hillary Clinton has “escaped prosecution more times than El Chapo!” Carly Fiorina declared. Then you had the main event with seven of the eight leading Republicans. That one began with moderator Megyn Kelly asking the man running in second place in Iowa about the polling   whom she described as, “the elephant NOT in the room. ” But, wait! There’s more. Across town, said Elephant  —   Donald J. Trump  —   gathered another   event in the freezing cold to raise some $6 million for wounded veterans. Not a political debate exactly, but not a shabby cause, either. Then, in the middle of Mr. Trump’s roll call of generous donations, here come two more Republican candidates from the undercard debate onto the stage to support Mr. Trump’s effort to raise money for wounded warriors. But Rick Santorum did not want to stand behind the podium emblazoned with a Trump sign. So he kind of noodled around from the side and spoke words into the microphone from the side of the podium. Mike Huckabee had no such qualms and just grabbed the podium with both hands when he spoke. Furiously flipping between the debate on Fox News and the Trump show on CNN, it was hard to keep track of everything. Perfect equilibrium was finally achieved when CNN put up a split screen with Huckabee speaking at the Trump show on one and a CNN reporter interviewed live from the media filing center over at the Fox News debate. As the reporter tried describing contents of yet another press release about    negotiations between Mr. Trump and Fox News, he was interrupted. Loud audio was being piped into the filing center so that all at once on a single screen a viewer could watch Mr. Trump nod approvingly as a GOP competitor spoke behind his podium and at the same time hear all the squabbling from the Fox News debate. Of course, the debate was worse off for that elephant who wasn’t in the room. It was a far more cordial and less spectacular event than previous GOP debates, especially the very first one. At one point in the evening, Sen. Ted Cruz, who suffers from being naturally unfunny, decided to try his hand at a witticism. “If you ask one more mean question, I may have to leave the stage,” he told the moderators. Get it? It was a shot at Mr. Trump? Who wasn’t there? It was a sharp reminder of the problem caused by Mr. Trump’s absence. Funny   come so easy to him. And when Mr. Trump takes a shot at you, there is no mistaking it. Not to be outdone, Sen. Marco Rubio tried his hand at jokeyness. “I’m not leaving this stage no matter what you ask me. ” Gulp. It might have been funnier if he had drunk some water when he said it. And herein lies the sad, sad truth about the future of politics in America. When this is all over and Mr. Trump has either been poisoned by fanatics suffering from Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome or he has served his complete eight years in office, he will be gone. And all that will be left are politicians, and it will never be this much fun again. • Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live. com and on Twitter via @charleshurt."
2016-02-01,"During a January 30 campaign speech at Iowa State University, Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton rebuked a proposed law allowing teenagers to use handguns while target shooting with their parents. [WeAreIowa. com reports that the proposed law —  the Youth Safety and Parental Rights Act —  is intended to recognize the legality of teenagers and   learning gun safety and target shooting with “a handgun with their parents permission and supervision. ” Clinton criticized the legislation by pointing a finger at the NRA and suggesting the law is being pushed so a    can legally own a gun.  According to Politico, Clinton said, “The NRA is interested in ‘lowering the age from 14 to let more children legally have guns. ” She suggested the law would result in more deaths when “children” find “loaded guns. ” Again, the proposed law is not about lowering the age for legal gun ownership. Rather, it is about making sure teens and   can learn gun safety and shoot a handgun with their parents’ “permission and supervision. ” And two of the bill’s strongest proponents,    Meredith Gibson and    Natalie Gibson, support the bill because they want to be able to go shooting with their father. On February 1 Breitbart News reached out to the NRA regarding the way Clinton characterized the law. The NRA said: This is the typical Hillary hypocrisy and double speak. Eight years ago when Hillary was trying to win over Second Amendment supporters, she talked about learning to shoot with her father when she was ‘a little girl.’ But now she wants to deny that same learning experience to youth in Iowa. These girls and their father are simply asking for the ability to do what youth in other states can do and what federal law expressly permits —   learn handgun safety from their parent in a safe and responsible way.

2016-02-02," The U. S. House of Representatives on Tuesday failed to override President Barack Obama’s veto of legislation that would have dismantled his signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. At least a   vote of the House was needed to knock down Obama’s veto; the   House fell short by more than three dozen votes. The vote was   and ends consideration of the bill; the Senate will not take it up. The widely expected outcome was the latest chapter in the lengthy clash between Republicans and Democrats over the Affordable Care Act, also known as ”Obamacare.”  Republicans have been vowing to gut the law since 2010, when the then   Congress passed the landmark program designed to provide healthcare for millions of uninsured Americans. The House has voted to dismantle Obamacare dozens of times, but Republicans could not get a repeal through the Senate until late last year, when they used a procedural maneuver denying Democrats’ ability to block the legislation. Obama vetoed the bill last month; it was the eighth veto of his presidency, and none have been overridden. Republicans were anxious to show they had done everything they could to take down Obamacare, which they say has raised insurance costs and reduced health care choices. They said Tuesday that this was not the end of the story. ”The end of Obamacare is coming,” predicted Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ”When a Republican president takes office next year, we know we can get this passed . .. Obamacare can be gone once and for all.” Such a scenario assumes, however, that the Republicans capture the White House in November elections, and maintain their majorities in the Senate and House as well. Democrats mocked Republicans, saying they were proposing to deprive millions of their health insurance without a replacement. About 11. 3 Americans have signed up this year for  insurance on the Obamacare exchanges. ”While we have voted as of today 63 times to dismantle it, how many times have we voted to replace it? Zero! Zero times to replace it!” declared Representative Chris van Hollen, a Democrat. The bill also would have taken funds away from Planned Parenthood, another target of Republican criticism after undercover videos showed the women’s healthcare provider discussing the use of fetus parts for research. Two   activists behind the filming of the videos  were indicted by a Texas grand jury last month, while the jury cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing.  (Reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Andrew Hay) WASHINGTON During his presidential campaign, Republican Donald Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ”strong leader” with whom he would like to reset tense U. S.  relations. NEW YORK The U. S. government was set to propose reduced biofuel use requirements in 2018, sources said on Wednesday, a move that could mark the first step toward triggering a broader overhaul to the controversial energy policy.

2016-02-03," Two people were injured and the 74 passengers and crew were evacuated after the Daallo Airlines plane landed safely at Mogadishu’s international airport, Somali aviation official Ali Mohamoud told the Associated Press. The pilot said he thought a bomb had caused the explosion and subsequent fire. An aviation expert who looked at photographs of the plane said the damage was consistent with an explosive device. The plane had been traveling to Djibouti in the Horn of Africa when it was forced to land just minutes after taking off from Mogadishu. “I think it was a bomb,” the pilot, Vladimir Vodopivec, told Serbian news site Blic. “Luckily, the flight controls were not damaged so I could return and land at the airport. Something like this has never happened in my flight career. We lost pressure in the cabin. Thank god it ended well. ” Awale Kullane, Somalia’s deputy ambassador to the U. N. who was on board, said on Facebook he “heard a loud noise and couldn’t see anything but smoke for a few seconds. ” When visibility returned, passengers realized “quite a chunk” of the plane was missing, he wrote. Kullane, who was going to Djibouti to attend a conference for diplomats, also posted a video showing some passengers putting on oxygen masks inside the plane. The post was later removed from his Facebook page. “We don’t know a lot, but certainly it looks like a device,” said John Goglia, a former member of the U. S. National Transportation Safety and aviation safety expert. There are only two things that could have caused a hole like the one in photos circulated online, said Goglia  —   a bomb or a pressurization blowout caused by a flaw or fatigue in the plane’s skin. Although Somali aviation officials said there were only two injuries, there were unverified reports that a person fell out of the hole, AP reported. Mohamed Hassan, a police officer in the nearby town of Balad, said residents had found the body of an old man who might have fallen from a plane.  "
2016-02-04,"Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders continued to hold commanding leads in New Hampshire, but challengers Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton are closing ground following their strong Iowa performances, a new poll revealed Thursday. Trump has the support of 36 percent of likely voters in next week’s GOP primary, ahead of Rubio (15 percent) Iowa caucus winner Ted Cruz (14 percent) Jeb Bush (8 percent) John Kasich (7 percent) Chris Christie (5 percent) and Ben Carson (4 percent) according to findings by the University of Massachusetts Lowell and  . This latest poll was taken between Monday and Wednesday. When UMass Lowell and WHDH canvassed likely GOP New Hampshire voters Friday through Sunday  —   so just before Iowa  —   Trump was on top with 38 percent but Rubio was all the way down in fifth place with just 8 percent. On the Democratic side, Sanders  —   from neighboring Vermont  —   led Clinton,   in this latest poll. But over the weekend, before Iowa, Sanders’ lead then was   according to the UMass Lowell and WHDH poll."
2016-02-05,"RNC Chief Strategist and Communications Director Sean Spicer responded to Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina’s criticisms of her exclusion from Saturday’s Republican debate on Friday’s “America’s Newsroom” on the Fox News Channel.  Spicer said, “ABC, as all networks, determine the criteria for the debates. They issued that criteria a month ago, and announced who made it yesterday as you saw. Look, I think that we’ve seen in the past, Governor Christie didn’t make the main stage once. Senator Paul didn’t. They worked hard, got back on it. I would hope that she would continue to work hard. And we’ve got several debates, one a week now going on. and if the voters  —   if she gets those numbers up she’ll be back on the stage, as did governor Christie, as did Senator Paul. ” When asked about Fiorina’s argument that she got more votes than Ohio Governor John Kasich and Christie in Iowa, and is tied with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in delegates, Spicer answered, “Well, look, you’ve got two candidates  —   three candidates rather that dropped out this week. Both Senator Paul and Governor Huckabee both got a delegate too. I think if they knew that the rules could be changed maybe they would have stayed in. So, I think, what do you say to them if you turn around and say well, if you, if you changed the rules, do they then get to get back in the race, and say, ‘Knowing that I could have been on the stage in New Hampshire, based on that, then I would get in.’ But the criteria was set. Everyone knew what it was, you know, and, so I think it would be highly unfair to turn around and change it retroactively at this point. ” He added, “I think that she’s a great candidate, and we’ve been blessed by tremendous amount  —   I think, we, the party have gone out of our way, since the beginning of this process, and you and Martha were there back in Cleveland last August, when we took the unprecedented step making sure that all of the top 17 candidates had a place on one or two stages, and have tried to maintain that as long as possible. So, when it comes to the party, we have gone out of our way, in a historic fashion, to ensure that as many voices of our candidates could be on stage as possible, but at some point the criteria is what it is, and we have to recognize that. ” When asked about Fiorina’s accusation that the game was “rigged” and there were “backroom deals,” Spicer stated, “[R]espectfully, they have been out there publicly, for a month now, as far as what they are. they have been for every network. They released them. They talk about what it’s going to take to get in. And so, you know, it is what it is. That’s all I can tell you. I think that they have been done fairly. These criteria that ABC has, are the most inclusive that anyone has been so far. They look at both how people placed in Iowa. They look at the top six in New Hampshire. They look at the top six nationally. There’s three ways to get into that. That’s probably the most inclusive criteria that we’ve had so far, going forward. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
2016-02-06,"We interrupt this very lively presidential primary season with an update from Wall Street: Bank stocks are getting killed in 2016. How bad? Like Jeb Bush in a debate with Donald Trump bad. In fact, with major bank stocks down at least double the rate of the Dow Jones industrial average  —   and the slide in oil prices, interest rates and the gross domestic product  —   some are starting to worry banks are facing the same troubles they did in 2008. Well, stop worrying. I chatted last week with a banking insider (John Kanas, chief exec of Bank United) and a frequent bank critic (analyst Mike Mayo of CLSA)  —   two people who wouldn’t normally agree on much. But they are in sync that the bank sector selloff is overdone, and 2016 is not a replay of 2008. For one thing, banks had weak foundations in 2008 but today have stronger foundations and balance sheets, Mayo said. While earnings may show some modest soft spots, Mayo said the underlying earnings are so robust that they will “increase book value even in a recession. ” Kanas agreed, saying everyone is concerned about the severe drop in the price of oil and how that could hurt banks, but the larger financial institutions’ exposure is small. Data show it’s at about 2 percent. Mayo said that, with the Federal Reserve stress tests, banks are more resilient in 2016 than ever. Kanas agrees. For example, the bank CEO noted, there is more equity in real estate deals today than in 2008. That indicates banks can deal with a much longer economic downturn than before, the CEO said. That’s why Mayo thinks the current is selloff in banks is overdone and the fears are nonsense. “You could have things snap back in a hurry,” he said. So I believe you now have one thing fewer to worry about this weekend. Go watch the Super Bowl and then get back into Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary fight."
2016-02-07,"The buzz built all week. And rumors that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Curb Your Enthusiasm star Larry David would appear on Saturday Night Live  —   together  —   were finally confirmed just before the weekend. But if you started watching SNL looking to #FeelTheBern, you might have had a moment of worry, at least at first. The Vermont senator did not appear in the show’s cold open. He did not come on stage during David’s monologue. He didn’t even appear in a   sketch all about him, called ”Bern Your Enthusiasm,” where David, playing Sanders, loses the Iowa caucuses by annoying just enough voters in the way only Larry David (or Bernie Sanders, or Larry David  —   we’re confused) can. It was smart, and with a cameo by a coughing,    Leslie Jones, it touched on Sanders’ lingering inability to attract widespread support from black voters. But Sanders finally did appear, in a skit where he and David play two men on a distressed ship headed to America, arguing over who gets into lifeboats first during a storm. Sanders’ character, Bernie Sanderswitzky, rails against Larry David’s character when he tries to get preferential treatment because he’s rich. ”I’m so sick of the 1 percent getting this preferential treatment,” Sanders says, alluding to one of his central campaign messages. David says that all sounds like socialism. Sanders corrects David, and replies, ”democratic socialism.” In the bit, Sanders’ character also makes light of his Jewish heritage, joking that he’d change his last name, Sanderswitzky, when he gets to America, ”so it doesn’t sound so Jewish.” Sanders’ campaign played up the senator’s appearance on Twitter. Near the start of the show, he tweeted out a fundraising appeal, with a Curb Your Enthusiasm reference: ”We need your vacuum pennies. Chip in a few,” read the tweet, with a link to donate. Overall, there wasn’t a lot of Sanders’ performance to judge. His cameo was definitely shorter than Donald Trump’s a few months ago, and seemed to have even fewer lines than Hillary Clinton as Val back in October. After his appearance in the steamship skit, Sanders did return to the stage as David introduced musical guest The 1975. ”It’s pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good,” Sanders said when David asked how his campaign is going. And at the end of the show, when the band plays and all the cast hugs and shakes hands, Sanders appeared again, soaking it all in, smiling. No curmudgeonly ”Bern Your Enthusiasm” Sanders present at all."
2016-02-08,"Monday on MSNBC’s New Hampshire primary coverage, “Hardball” host Chris Matthews said former President Bill Clinton was a “little rusty” while on the campaign trail for his wife Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  After playing a clip of Bill Clinton, Matthews said, “You know, I hate to tell you, this is a hard call. I think Bernie Sanders right now is a better campaigner than Bill  Clinton. Bernie Sanders is on his game. Bill’s out of  —   a little rusty. ”"
2016-02-09,"‘Eminent domain is an absolute necessity,” said Donald Trump during Saturday’s Republican presidential debate. “Without it,” he claimed, “you wouldn’t have roads, you wouldn’t have hospitals, you wouldn’t have anything. You wouldn’t have schools, you wouldn’t have bridges. You need eminent domain. ” In fact, though, we would still have roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals. It’s a relatively new phenomenon for the government to seize property on behalf of private development projects. And yet, so very many of these projects somehow used to get done. Only one thing is certain when it comes to eminent domain: Those who have their property seized don’t get paid enough for it. Suppose that Trump wants to build a skyscraper and has to tear down the houses on an entire block. The obvious approach is to buy everyone‘s house, but this doesn’t always work. Because of sentimental attachment, some homeowners will refuse even offers that far exceed the fair market value. Other homeowners might act strategically, refusing early offers in the hopes of enticing much higher bids. This presents a complex problem, for a single holdout could stop the project in its tracks. Eminent domain seeks to solve this problem by forcing owners to accept a “fair market value” price. The government determines this price by seeing how much similar houses in the neighborhood have sold for. If the homeowner refuses, the government can pay this price anyway and seize the property. Until 2005, eminent domain was usually invoked only for government projects such as highways and railroads. But in that year, the U. S. Supreme Court decreed, in Kelo v. New London, that eminent domain can be enforced for private development projects. So long as local authorities believe that the project will benefit the wider community, there is no problem. Unfortunately, the “fair market value” price is typically too low. If people only valued their homes at the market price, they would have already sold them before receiving the developer’s offer. The fact that they haven’t means that they value their abodes more than what is being offered on the free market. The real difficulty lies in figuring out how much more. If the government takes the property of someone who values the property more than does the person who is getting it, society is poorer. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Fortunately, there is a solution  —   one that businesses used for years before they gained access to eminent domain. Whether they seek to build a pipeline, a road, or a building, companies almost always consider multiple possible locations. For decades, Koch Industries, the largest privately owned company in the United States, built   and oil pipelines, just like the Keystone Pipeline, across many thousands of miles without using eminent domain. Their approach was to offer a contract to property owners along different possible routes the deal would go to whichever complete set of property owners signed the contract first. The owners might be offered, for example, 25 percent above the fair market value. If they value their property more than that, they don’t have to sell. But the Kochs’ approach discourages people from indefinitely holding out for better offers. If the homeowners wait, they risk losing this 25 percent profit. This is clearly a better alternative to forced sales at prices that, in reality, are anything but “fair. ” Trump’s claim that “The Keystone Pipeline, without eminent domain, it wouldn’t go ten feet” is just wrong. Nor was Jeb Bush right that eminent domain is necessary for the government, which faces the same alternatives. More Donald Trump A Question Needing an AnswerIs Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? You gotta have heart, c. During the Saturday debate, Trump was asked about his attempt to seize the house of an elderly woman in Atlantic City, N. J. because he wanted a place to park limousines for his casino. Trump claimed: “The woman ultimately didn’t want to do that. I walked away. ” In fact, Trump didn’t simply accept the woman’s decision not to sell him her property. Trump neglected to mention that the Superior Court of New Jersey upheld the woman’s right to keep her home. Once again, the Atlantic City case raises the important point that there are almost always different places that a parking lot or a building or a pipeline can be built. Trump should follow the Kochs’ example. For that matter, the government itself would be well advised to use this   approach.  —   John R.

And I said I actually think that they like me a lot,” Trump said.’ ’”I have so many friends up here and they are special, special people,” he added. ”So New Hampshire: I want to thank you. We love you. We’’re going to be back a lot. We’’re not going to forget you. ”’ ’After that introduction, Trump returned to a number of lines that closely resembled the stump speech he sometimes gives multiple times a day.’ ’”We’’re going to beat China, Japan. We’’re going to beat Mexico with trade,” he said. ”We’’re going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis.

2016-02-11," The issue of trade has become a hot one for both parties this cycle. Donald Trump’s made the case that the United States is getting screwed on free trade  —   that U. S. policies have ruined the wages for the American worker. In a radio interview on South Carolina’s Vince Coakley Radio Program, Heidi Cruz argued free trade is a powerfully good force and that presidents should have increased powers to negotiate trade deals  —   a policy that has become particularly controversial over the last year as President Obama has pushed for what’s called   authority (TPA) to negotiate a U. S.  Pacific trade agreement. And then she said Ted Cruz voted for TPA. Sen. Cruz, while initially voting for TPA in May of 2015, was one of only five Republicans to vote against it when it came up for another vote in the Senate later that June. At the time, Cruz explained that his reversal was a result of his opposition to the   Bank and new immigration provisions introduced by the House.  A Cruz spokesman told BuzzFeed News: “Cruz supports free trade but voted against TPA because he did not want President Obama to have the authority to unilaterally make bad trade deals. ” Here’s Heidi Cruz’s case for free trade:  “Well Ted is a free trader, he’s always been a free trader, and that is why he voted for the Trade Promotion Authority in Congress. That being said, what is —  and the reason he is for free trade is because it creates American jobs. We’ve done a study on the campaign as to how many jobs free trade has created for various states in the country, and the numbers are in the hundreds of thousands depending on the size of the state. And so I’d encourage your listeners to look at those types of statistics. Free trade creates jobs for Americans. Ted has integrated into his tax plan a tax break for exports so that companies that producing for export will not be taxed in the U. S. which gives them any advantage in selling abroad.  “The second thing, though, and equally important, they must go part and parcel, is that we must be negotiating the right free trade agreements that are good for America and not bad for America. And this president has not proven that he’s able to do so, and so Ted voted against the TPP, the deal with Asia. And the reason he voted against it is, he actually goes and reads the bills that he votes on and the agreements that are negotiated. Ted went down into the SCIF, he read through the pages of this agreement. He made the observation that this was not a good agreement for America. This president is not negotiating good deals for our country, there are immigration things in there. There are things that don’t belong in there, and he voted against that agreement.  “Let me remind you listeners that the trade promotion authority for the bill that gives Congress the right to give to executive branch the ability to negotiate trade on the behalf of the country. This is a six year lasting situation, so in the Constitution the authority for trade is given to the Congress, but because of all the different interests, it was deemed a long time ago that the executive should argue on behalf of the American people, but that Congress should approve or disapprove. And this lasts for six years, and so if we deny the ability for our executive to negotiate trade agreements on our behalf, and then be reviewed by Congress  —  which should be a very assiduous process  —   we will be also denying the next president because this president only has just about eight months left in office. ”  "
2016-02-12," Gold vaulted more than 5 percent on Thursday to a   high, on track for its biggest daily jump in more than seven years as financial uncertainty, a lower dollar and tumbling stock prices around the world prompted investors to seek refuge in bullion. Volume of the   U. S. gold futures contract surged to the highest since   as investors poured into the market. Traders cited fears of financial instability and slumping bank shares on both sides of the Atlantic. Investors grew more worried about banks’ profitability in a   and   rate environment. U. S. Treasury yields tumbled in another   play that also bolstered demand for gold.  ”The   seekers are moving back. We recommend clients add gold to their portfolios as insurance, if things turn out really bad, there will be much more upside,” said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. ”Look at the massive inflows into ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) this year. They put the price recovery on a much more solid footing than any of the other recoveries we’ve seen over the past couple of years.” Spot gold XAU= was up 5 percent at $1, 257. 26 an ounce at 2:40 p. m. EST (1940 GMT) after surging 5. 3 percent to $1, 260. 60, the highest since February 2015. It was on track for its biggest daily rise since January 2009.  ”Due to the grave concerns, especially now due to the European bank system, there’s a flight to safety into gold,” said Jeffrey Sica, chief investment officer of Sica Wealth Management in Morristown, New Jersey. ”Gold has been in reverse correlation to stock markets so we anticipate further stock declines with further increased investment in gold.” U. S. gold futures for April delivery GCJ6 settled up 4. 5 percent at $1, 247. 80 per ounce, with unusually heavy options activity in March and April calls at $1, 250 and $1, 300.  ”It’s just a lot of short squeezing going on as well as a bunch of new investors jumping in. It’s a herd mentality,” said one New York trader, pointing to the record net short position that was held by hedge funds and money managers in  . The rally extended after U. S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, during her biannual testimony to the U. S. Senate Banking Committee, said she will not take the consideration of negative rates off the table. Spot gold has risen nearly 18 percent in 2016 so far, following three years of losses. Gold’s downward trajectory started in May 2013 when former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke first mentioned tapering or reducing monthly bond purchases and markets started to think about eventual higher U. S. rates. The Fed eventually raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade, but expectations about the pace of U. S. rate rises and the magnitude have been scaled back. This has been reinforced by Yellen saying tighter credit markets, volatile financial markets, and uncertainty over Chinese economic growth had raised risks to the U. S. economy. Holdings of the largest      (ETF) New York’s SPDR Gold Trust, have jumped more than 9 percent to surpass 22. 57 million ounces.  The benchmark   U. S. Treasury yield US10YT=RR fell to lows last seen in 2012, when the Fed was printing money as investors piled into assets used to hedge against economic and financial uncertainty. ”Investors are returning to gold as a core diversifier and safe haven investment,” James Butterfill, head of research at ETF Securities, said in a note. ”Given the increasingly challenging investment and economic environment, we expect this trend to continue.” Silver rose 4. 4 percent to $15. 95 an ounce, a     high. Spot platinum XPT= climbed 3. 8 percent to a   high at $967. 17, while palladium XPD= rose 2. 1 percent to $530. 46, a   high.  (Additional reporting by Pratima Desai in London and A.

2016-02-13," Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed sharply in a debate on Thursday over their support for President Barack Obama, with Sanders accusing Clinton of ”a low blow” after she compared him to Republicans. As the Democratic race moves to states with large minority populations, both candidates openly courted black and Hispanic votes during a debate that was far more restrained and cordial than last week’s contentious debate in New Hampshire. In the sharpest exchange of the night, Clinton attacked Sanders for being too critical of Obama, who is extremely popular with the black voters who will play a big role in the outcome in South Carolina and other upcoming nominating contests. ”The kind of criticism that we’ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president, I expect from Republicans, I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama,” said Clinton, who served as secretary of state during Obama’s first term. ”Madam Secretary, that is a low blow,” said Sanders, a U. S. senator from Vermont. Sanders said he had been an Obama ally in the Senate even if he did not always agree with him. ”Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?” Sanders said. Clinton, who has eagerly embraced Obama’s legacy, said Sanders had called Obama weak and a disappointment, and ”that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.” With Clinton looking to rebound after her crushing   loss to Sanders in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, the two also differed over healthcare and Wall Street.  Even so, the restrained exchange on Thursday was unlikely to change the trajectory of a race that has intensified dramatically over two weeks. Clinton accused Sanders of misleading Americans on his healthcare. She said his proposal for a      healthcare plan would mean dismantling the program known as Obamacare and triggering another intense political struggle. ”Based on every analysis I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don’t add up,” Clinton told Sanders. ”That’s a promise that cannot be kept.” Sanders said he was simply moving to provide what most industrialized countries have   healthcare coverage for all. ”We’re not going to dismantle anything,” Sanders said. ”In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.” Sanders also repeated his accusation that Clinton is too beholden to the Wall Street interests she once represented as a U. S. senator from New York, noting her Super PAC received $15 million in donations from Wall Street. ”Let’s not insult the intelligence of the American people,” he said. ”Why in God’s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it, they want to throw money around.” Clinton said the donations did not mean she was in Wall Street’s pocket, and noted that President Barack Obama had taken donations from Wall Street during his campaigns. ”When it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street,” she said. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND RACE With an eye to on the minority vote, both candidates decried the high incarceration rate of   and called for broad reforms of the criminal justice system. Sanders said the disproportionately high rate of incarceration for black men was ”one of the great tragedies” in the United States. He called for ”fundamental police reform” that would ”make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will in fact be dealt with.” Clinton criticized what she called ”systemic racism” in education, housing and employment. ”When we talk about criminal justice reform   …     we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing and other ways of helping communities of color,” she said. They both agreed on the need for immigration reform, an important issue to Hispanic voters, though they clashed over the Obama administration’s actions on handling a wave of undocumented children who entered the country alone. Clinton criticized Sanders for voting against a reform measure in 2007, which Sanders defended because of a provision in the bill for guest workers. Clinton entered Thursday’s debate under acute pressure to calm growing nervousness among her supporters after her drubbing in New Hampshire and a   win the prior week in the Iowa caucus. Both states have nearly   populations. For his part, Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, hoped to harness the momentum and enthusiasm he gained from the first two contests and prove he can be a viable contender to lead the Democratic Party to victory in the Nov. 8 presidential election. ”What our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics,” Sanders said. ”They want a political revolution.” Clinton dodged an opportunity to distance herself from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s recent controversial comments that there was ”a special place in hell” for women who don’t support other women. ”Look, I think that she’s been saying that for as long as I’ve known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn’t change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make,” she said. On the foreign policy front, Sanders criticized Clinton for her warm relationship for Henry Kissinger, who served as secretary of state under Republican President Richard Nixon during the Vietnam War. Sanders called Kissinger ”one of the most destructive secretaries of state.” Asked by Clinton about who his foreign policy advisers were, Sanders shot back: ”Well it ain’t Henry Kissinger.” The race now moves to what should be more favorable ground for Clinton in Nevada and South Carolina, states with more black and Hispanic voters, who, polls show, have been more supportive of Clinton so far.

2016-02-14,"This year is the third presidential election of 2008. Oh, sure, it’s 2016. But the financial cataclysm and economic   that slammed us eight years ago haunts us still. But this time, it’s the leading Democrat who’s getting tripped up by it, not the leading Republican. The conventional wisdom of the 2008 election is that Barack Obama won because he was just such a special candidate: a black man with a compelling personal story and an uplifting message of hope who inspired record turnout among minorities and young people. That’s true. But what’s also true is that the market meltdown of September 2008 obliterated any Republican’s chances. Like it or not, it was true and it still is: George W. Bush was president when people’s mothers called them in a panic and asked them if they should take their money out of Citibank. Nine million people began to lose their jobs. Corporate executives called Treasury officials begging for cash to meet payroll. It didn’t help that John McCain ran back to Washington in a fluster, “suspending” his campaign and trying to delay a debate. Meanwhile, Obama had already given one   economic speech months before. Introduced by Mayor Mike Bloomberg in downtown Manhattan that March, he called for “a shift in the culture of our financial institutions and our regulatory agencies. ” And in the crisis, he kept his cool. Six weeks later, he made history.   to 2012. Republicans’ strategy was the Reagan strategy: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? People obviously weren’t. Yet this tack failed. Why? People could see with their own eyes that Obama hadn’t caused the mess, and that no one could have made it disappear in four years. Americans had spent the decade before Obama came into office borrowing way more money than they could ever afford to pay back. If you look at the stats, they had spent nearly three decades doing that  —   back to the Reagan years, when wage growth for the working and middle class stalled out. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney missed chance after chance to try to blunt the fact that in most people’s eyes, he came from the same industry that had stripped middle America of its jobs. He could have said he’d use his insider knowledge to fix this broken industry. But he didn’t. He never seemed to know he had a problem. Now, it’s 2016. The leading Republican is a guy who forces banks to their knees when his casinos go bankrupt. People like this. And who has the big 2008 problem? Hillary Clinton. As everyone knows, Hillary took $675, 000 from Goldman Sachs for three speeches. But this isn’t Hillary’s biggest problem. She could fix this in an instant, by giving the money back, or by giving it to people  —   maybe in Florida!  —   who lost their homes and their jobs after 2008. She could say that after having spent the past months talking to people young and old, she understands in a way she didn’t before how deeply the financial crisis affected the country. She’s learned  —   and changed. This isn’t hard. And she should release the transcripts from those speeches. No, it won’t help her  —   it’ll only demonstrate that she got paid to say, at best, nothing. She should do it, though, because if she doesn’t, someone else will. This, too, isn’t hard. But Hillary can’t do that because she  —   and her advisers  —   don’t understand that this is an enduring problem. She seems to think that Bernie Sanders created this climate, not that millions of young voters created him. And when Sanders says Wall Street’s business model is based on fraud, the establishment titters. Even Clinton doesn’t seem to grasp that to most people, this is a perfectly moderate statement. Just last week, Morgan Stanley paid a $3. 2 billion fine stemming from   . . . fraud. Hillary may squeeze through the primary, as Romney did. But she’ll be weak. If she wins, it’s only because voters are finally over 2008  —   and eight years later, that’s still a risky bet to make.  "

(NWS)  CWG’s Jeff Halverson points out that recent weather analyses show a small area of weak low pressure that has developed near the mouth of the bay.    Surface analysis shows a weak low near the mouth of the Chesapeake. (SPC, modified by Jeff Halverson)  This feature may help the cold air linger by keeping winds from coming out of warm directions, at least for now. Eventually, the developing storm over Alabama  —   and warmer winds ahead of it  —   works close enough to the region that it should overpower the little coastal low. Recent   modeling keeps the whole area near or below freezing until near or after midnight. It then rapidly warms everyone above freezing into sunrise. 5:45 p. m. update: Going wider again, we see this storm system is quite sprawling. Today’s snow activity has moved north of the area, and lots of moisture is gathering to the southwest. A low pressure system forming down in Alabama has caused severe weather across the Gulf Coast region this afternoon. A number of reports of tornadoes have come in from that region.

There’s some model indication this may congeal into a uniform zone of freezing rain and rain as it moves toward us from the Carolinas this evening and overnight, but that’s not a guarantee. 5:25 p. m. update: Much of the steady precipitation has moved north of the area. For the next few hours at least, it should tend to be more spotty and showery, although freezing drizzle is possible in the lulls. A radar snapshot early this evening shows that well. Although many spots have turned over to freezing rain, some sleet may fall in heavier activity.    Radar snapshot near and after 5 p. m. this evening.

A flood watch is in effect across the region as heavy rain is possible (around one inch) as temperatures rise to 50 degrees or so. All this means we’re going to have a rapid snow and ice melt and heavy rain falling at the same time. Streams and creeks as well as poor drainage areas are at risk of flooding. The heaviest rain is likely in the morning between rush hour and midday.    The GFS model shows heavy rain having fallen between 7 a. m. and 1 p. m Tuesday.

Use extra caution as the ice glaze builds. 3:20 p. m. update: A wide view of this storm system shows we’ve got awhile to go. Temperatures are slowly rising through the 20s to around 30 locally and snow is changing to freezing rain across the region.    Radar and temperatures across the region. (Weather Underground)  There’s still no apparent warm push targeting the area, but temperatures will continue to slowly rise through the evening. As low pressure organizes to the south, we’ll eventually see a more significant rise overnight toward morning. One potential positive is that precipitation seems to want to be somewhat showery in the time ahead, which may be able to limit ice accumulation, at least in spots. 2:55 p. m. update: As the next area of precipitation pushes in, reports and radar tend to indicate the snow is done except for perhaps a few intermixed flakes. Going straight to sleet and quickly to freezing rain appears to be the story. An icy glaze is likely to develop on all untreated surfaces in the hours ahead.    2:55 p. m. radar snapshot shows mixed precipitation moving back into the D. C. area from the south.

There is still some question as to exactly when everyone rises above freezing this evening and tonight, even in the city.

(Weatherbell. com)  11:50 a. m. update: For the most part, snowfall intensity has dwindled lately. There are still some moderate bursts intermixed. A lull between this morning’s snowfall and the next batch of precipitation is working this way from the south.    Radar snapshot around 11:45 a. m. (College of Dupage)  We should tend to see snowfall rates continue to diminish in the hour ahead (a little longer well north of the city) and it might even stop for a time. The lull could be rather short lived as the next batch moves this way from roughly a Charlottesville to Richmond line. Some showery snowfall is ongoing in the lull area as well. Mixing with sleet and eventually freezing rain will likely come with the next batch as we head through the afternoon. 11:30 a. m. update: Word of many delays and cancellations at area airports continues to pour in.

One of our   models, known as the HRRR, predicts it will occur between about 2 and 4 p. m. pushing through the region from southeast to northwest. Here’s a simulation showing the   line cutting through D. C. at 3 p. m.    HRRR model shows snow changing to ice around D. C. around 3 p. m. (WeatherBell. com)  The changeover timing is consistent with other models like the NAM and SREF. The National Weather Service posted an analysis showing the mix line near Richmond around 9:45 a. m. pushing northwest. The practical implications of the changeover means accumulating snow will stop, and ice accumulation will commence of up to a few hundredths of an inch per hour  …    adding a glaze on top of everything. 9:40 a. m. update: The next two to three hours are likely to present the worst of the storm in terms of accumulating snow and deteriorating road conditions. Snow should fall at a rate at about half an inch per hour, sometimes increasing to an inch per hour. We’re still anticipating a transition to mixed precipitation in the    afternoon.   @capitalweather solid band right over Fair Lakes.

Basically, much of the D. C. metro region is in a winter storm warning except our northern and northeastern suburbs, including Montgomery County, Howard County, and Anne Arundel County, which are under winter weather advisories.  The expanded advisory into D. C. is due to snowfall amounts that may reach five inches along with the expected ice on top. 8:53 a. m. update: A little on road conditions  —   we’re hearing and seeing that major roads are looking pretty good. The break in the snow this morning helped road crews get a jump on it, and the major thoroughfares are wet but not slippery. Side streets have a good coating of snow on them so avoid those if possible. The only place we’ve heard things are dicey is Montgomery County, where they have a “  rule. ” They only put plows down if snow exceeds three inches. So we’ve heard even some of the main roads are slippery around the Rockville area. Metro is running on time on a Saturday schedule, but bus service is running the severe plan, which means service is limited to major corridors only. Snow is picking up across the region, so road conditions could deteriorate as we head into the late morning. If you need to get somewhere, now might be the time to leave while the roads are still in decent shape.   @capitalweather Drove from Petworth to Gtown Hospital.

The HRRR model suggests the 10 and 11 a. m. hours could bring moderately heavy snow which could lead to another inch or two of accumulation for the metro area.     7:15 a. m. update: As the sun started to come up, readers shared their snowy scenes with us.

Since last night, the high resolution models have been suggesting that we could see a lull in the snow around this time, so this is not unexpected. The HRRR is pegging the 7 to 9 a. m. time frame for snow to return to the metro, from south to north. That might be just a little bit fast based on what we’re seeing on radar, but it does give us a rough idea, which is helpful for people who need to get places since not everyone is off on this President’s Day.

2016-02-16,"Airstrikes hit four hospitals and a school building in northern Syria Monday, killing at least 50 people, according to various media reports. [Eight others are missing and presumed dead. The   Syrian government forces have been accused of carrying out the airstrikes.  Citing an unnamed hospital worker on the scene, CNN reports that 15 people were killed and up to 40 others were injured, including women and children, when airstrikes struck the Women and Children’s Hospital and a school building that was housing displaced people in Azaz, located in Syria’s Aleppo province. Another medical facility located in Syria’s Idlib province, about 62 miles away from the Women and Children’s Hospital, was also stuck in a separate attack, adds CNN. “At least seven people were killed and eight are missing and presumed dead following a Monday morning attack in northern Syria that destroyed a hospital supported by Doctors Without   Sans Frontières (MSF),” reports the humanitarian organization. “The hospital in Ma’arat Al Numan, Idlib Province, was hit by four missiles in two attacks within a few minutes of each other, according to staff from the hospital,” it adds. “Five patients, one patient caretaker, and a hospital guard were killed. Eight staff members are missing and presumed dead. Other patients are still missing, but their numbers are currently unknown. ” Two other hospitals operated by the United Nations, for a total of four, were also bombed Monday, reports The New York Times.  “As always, caught in the middle are civilians, with four hospitals bombed in a single day on Monday and Turkey and the Syrian insurgents accusing Russia of targeting them deliberately to drive them out of the area, ” notes the report. “Two of the hospitals were supported by Unicef, including a pediatric and maternity hospital, and at least 50 people were killed in all of the attacks, including children, said Farhan Haq, a United Nations spokesman. ” The October 2015 U. S. bombing of a hospital in Afghanistan operated by Doctors Without Borders, known officially as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sparked international outrage, prompting President Obama and the Pentagon to issue an apology for the mistaken attack that killed at least 30 people. U. S. Gen. John Campbell, the top commander of American and international troops in Afghanistan, said the bombing of the hospital was “the direct result of human error compounded by systems and procedural failures,” noting that military personnel who were closely involved in the bombing have been suspended. The United States, Turkey, Amnesty International, and Doctors Without Borders have accused Assad troops, backed by Russia, of carrying out the attacks. “The United States condemns airstrikes conducted in and around Aleppo today against innocent civilian targets, including a hospital run by Médecins Sans Frontières [MSF] and the Women’s and Children’s hospital in Azaz city,” declared the State Department in a statement. “That the Assad regime and its supporters would continue these attacks, without cause and without sufficient regard for international obligations to safeguard innocent lives, flies in the face of the unanimous calls by the [International Syria Support Group] ISSG, including in Munich, to avoid attacks on civilians and casts doubt on Russia’s willingness   ability to help bring to a stop the continued brutality of the Assad regime against its own people,” it adds. Echoing the State Department, Amnesty International called on Russian and Syrian forces to stop deliberate attacks on hospitals, clinics, and medical personnel. “Russian and Syrian forces know full well that deliberate attacks on medical facilities are war crimes. All parties to the conflict must cease such horrific attacks, stop destroying medical facilities and allow medical workers to carry out their   work without fear of being killed or injured in the line of duty,” Said Boumedouha, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Program Director at Amnesty International, said in a statement. MSF president Mego Terzian told Reuters “either the [Syrian] government or Russia” was responsible for carrying out the strikes that destroyed the MSF facility in Idlib province. Riad Haddad, Syria’s ambassador to Russia, accused the U. S.  coalition forces of the attack on the MSF facility in Idlib, an allegation that the Pentagon has denied. “The destruction of the   facility appears to be a deliberate attack on a health structure,” said Massimiliano Rebaudengo, MSF Head of Mission, adding, “The destruction of the hospital leaves the local population of around 40, 000 people without access to medical services in an active zone of conflict. ” Last September, Russia began launching airstrikes in support of the Assad regime’s offensive against rebels. “Speaking in Kiev, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu blamed Russia for the strikes in Azaz, which is close to the Turkish border, claiming Moscow had targeted the complex with ballistic missiles fired from the Caspian Sea,” reports CNN. CNN acknowledges that Moscow has not commented on the attacks."
2016-02-17,"At the Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire on February 6, Senator Marco Rubio called Hillary Clinton an extremist on abortion because she supports    up to “the baby’s due date. ” Mrs. Clinton promptly rejected that charge, saying that she does support restrictions on abortion “in the very end of the third trimester. ” She went on to tell ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that those restrictions should not apply in cases of the life and health of the mother, and that “rape and incest have to be always taken into account. ”   years of Roe v. Wade have shown that allowing a woman’s health exception to a   abortion ban is a loophole so big as to make the underlying restriction meaningless. It applies to anyone who claims to feel “mental distress” at the thought of having a baby. And it’s hard to take seriously the idea that a woman who stood by as her husband vetoed a law to prohibit the gruesome practice of   abortion now opposes the very abortions the technique was designed to administer. RELATED: Dreaming about Another Kind of Hillary Clinton, The majority of   abortions are done on healthy babies developing normally through uncomplicated pregnancies. Does Mrs. Clinton support a ban on those abortions? Does Mrs. Clinton support a law prohibiting abortions for sex selection? These abortions primarily affect female babies. What about abortions to reduce triplets to twins? A surrogate mother in Georgia is being pressured to have such an abortion, simply because the babies’ parents don’t want a third child. Abortion, particularly late in pregnancy, often targets the handicapped for elimination. The number of babies born with Down’s syndrome has been declining as more parents opt for abortion after a prenatal diagnosis. Ohio and Missouri have passed laws to prohibit such abortions, with more states to follow. Does Mrs. Clinton agree that Down’s syndrome babies should be protected from abortion? Share article on FacebookshareTweet Senator Rubio was right  —   it’s a scandal that in five Democratic debates, not one question has been asked about abortion, but it’s not surprising. The Democratic party’s extreme position in favor of abortion, expressed in the party’s platform, puts it at odds with the American people. That’s why Hillary Clinton felt compelled to reject Senator Rubio’s claim that she supports abortion up to a baby’s due date within hours of the claim being made. Her interviewers on the Sunday shows seemed more interested to know what exceptions she would allow rather than which abortions she would restrict. It’s too bad the rest of the media seems equally unwilling to elicit this information from the Democratic frontrunner. RELATED:   Movement: Progress Is on Our Side, This issue takes on even more urgency now with the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia and the possibility that Mrs. Clinton will choose his successor. His replacement could uphold or strike down even today’s modest abortion limits, like the Congressional bans on   abortion and   abortions. We are no longer dealing in hypotheticals. I, for one, welcome Mrs. Clinton’s support for any restriction whatsoever on abortion, no matter how small. Legislation to enact a restriction she supports would pass Congress in a heartbeat. I hope over the course of the campaign she will be forced to name one.,"
2016-02-18,"Pope Francis attacked Republican   Donald Trump Thursday as “not a Christian. ” Aboard his plane, the pope was asked specifically about comments Trump made about the Pope’s visit to the Mexico border. The pope did not mince his words.  A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian. This is not the Gospel. As far as what you said about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I am not getting involved in that. I say only this man is not Christian if he has said things like that. Breitbart’s Alex Swoyer, live from Trump’s latest South Carolina rally, reports Trump’s response: [The Pope] actually said that maybe I’m not a good Christian, which is really not a nice thing to say. If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president, because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk no action politicians.  —    —   The pope only heard one side of the story. He didn’t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. The Mexican government its leadership have made many disparaging remarks about me. REMINDER: The Pope lives in a Vatican City surrounded by towering walls. If the translation is correct, the Pope is going way beyond “Who am I to judge?” (his famous comments about homosexuals) to declaring a man “not a Christian” over one issue. To condemn an entire man over this one issue, especially when the Pope himself lives behind towering walls, is hard to grasp. UPDATE: Ben Carson joined Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush in defending Trump: “It would be hilarious if it weren’t so sad,” Carson said. “We’ve seen this before in history where people get distracted and don’t look at what’s important. They lose their vision. ” Carson refused to comment, however, on whether Trump’s public conduct means he is not a true man of faith. “I’m not going to judge Donald Trump in terms of whether he’s a Christian or not,” said Carson, a Seventh Day Adventist. “Certainly some of the things that he does may not be suggestive of Christianity, but then again, all of us have weaknesses and shortcomings,” he added of Trump, a Presbyterian. “That’s what it’s all about. ” The Carson campaign later released a statement: “I have spoken often about the need for faith and compassion in America. However, enforcing our immigration laws is not in contradiction with love and kindness. As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors. But as a nation, we must also defend our sovereignty and security. Ending human trafficking into America can save lives and protect the weakest of society from exploitation and working with Mexico and other Central and South American nations to improve their own governments and economies is a greater service to others than opening our borders. ” UPDATE: Jeb defended Trump and a border wall. “I think the Pope said Trump is  . That’s between him and his Creator   …     it is not   to protect your border, to keep people out who come here illegally. ” UPDATE: Rubio pushed back against Pope: “Vatican City controls who comes in, when they come in, and how they come in, as a  . The United States has a right to do that, as well. ” UPDATE: Trump’s full official statement: If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians. The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them. The Pope only heard one side of the story  —   he didn’t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn’t see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation. For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President. No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith.

2016-02-19," Confidence at Japanese manufacturers remained largely subdued in February and the mood was seen deteriorating over the coming three months, a Reuters poll showed, highlighting concerns about slowing global growth and turbulent markets. In a sign of the stiff headwinds dragging on growth in the world’s   economy,   sentiment also soured though it was expected to stabilize somewhat in the near term, the Reuters Tankan showed. The monthly poll, which strongly correlates with the Bank of Japan’s quarterly tankan survey, suggested the economy remains underpowered after declines in exports and consumer spending led to a contraction in output in the fourth quarter. The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers inched up to 7 in February from 6 in January, helped by gains in food processing and precision machinery industries, while cars, steel and oil refineries sagged. It is seen falling to 4 in May. ”The results showed gradual worsening of corporate sentiment as declines in demand have become more evident after markets turned into a   mode,” said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at SMBC Friend Securities. ”There’s no driver of growth. If domestic demand remains lackluster on top of weak exports, that could mount pressure on not just the BOJ but the government to respond by taking fresh stimulus steps,” she said. The poll of 513 big and   Japanese companies between Feb.   of which 265 responded, was taken at a time when heightened global risk aversion shook up the yen. The   Japanese currency rose sharply, hurting exporters’ morale as the dollar fell to a   low below 111 yen   last week. HEADWINDS Japan’s economy contracted by an annualized 1. 4 percent in   as private consumption and exports slumped. While analysts expect a moderate recovery, stagnant wages, depressed consumer prices and faltering global growth have raised fresh doubts about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cocktail of stimulus policies aimed at quashing years of deflation.  Even the central bank’s shock adoption of negative interest rates late last month has hardly helped turn around business sentiment, as it failed to boost Tokyo stock prices or weaken the yen. ”Demand from China has slowed a lot and there are signs of demand for some   parts declining,” a manager at a rubber maker said in the survey. An electric machinery producer said: ”Our business results stand at the previous year’s levels but have somewhat fallen short of our estimate. Yen rises could aggravate the situation.” The service sector index fell to 21 from 27 in January, weighed by retailers and wholesalers. The index is seen unchanged in the next three months.  (Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi Nakagawa; Editing by Shri Navaratnam) WASHINGTON New orders for U. S.  goods fell more than expected in May, but orders for capital equipment were a bit stronger than previously reported, suggesting the manufacturing sector remained on a moderate growth path. U. S. credit card processor Vantiv agreed to buy Britain’s Worldpay for 7. 7 billion pounds ($10 billion) on Wednesday in a move expected to trigger further deals. "

He’s a Hummer doing 90. weaving in and out of traffic. He is dominating all elements of the GOP demographic coalition not just those who are angry’: Donald Trump’s victory in the South Carolina primary demonstrated his strength among Republican voters of all stripes and even helped force Jeb Bush, once considered the likely frontrunner in the GOP presidential contest, to suspend his campaign —  a sign of how the real estate mogul has upended politics. Despite his   with Pope Francis, the state’s governor endorsing his rival and the appearance in the state of George W. Bush to help his brother, Trump won big in South Carolina. According to exit polls, he carried veterans and older voters, virtually tied Ted Cruz for the evangelical vote and dominated among voters with no college, some college and college degrees. He won moderates and conservatives. His only weaknesses were among   “very conservative” voters, the more affluent and voters with graduate degrees. None of this means that Trump is unstoppable. But he’s also won secular New Hampshire, where less than a quarter of the state’s Republican primary voters were evangelical. (In South Carolina, it’s 69 percent.) He came in second in the Iowa Caucuses. The southern states that dominate the March 1 and March 15 primary dates also seem like very fertile ground for the real estate mogul. “Let’s put this thing away,” said a very competant Trump as he declared victory and looked forward to the upcoming contests. [  …    ] It’s become cliche in the presidential campaign to talk about candidates having different lanes —  an outsider lane, an establishmient lane, etc. But Trump has no lane. He’s a Hummer doing 90. weaving in and out of traffic. He is dominating all elements of the GOP demographic coalition not just those who are angry. At this point here is no certainty, as Washington insisders had once hoped, that as the field narrowed Trump would be stopped either because voters somehow came to their senses or because the party would coalesce around a less controversial alternative. But that seems less likely. The thinning field has actually strengthened Trump and while it’s possible that in a    race Cruz or Rubio could beat Trump but so far, with the exception of one outlier poll, the evidence suggests that Trump could beat them. 10:15: Kasich thinks it’s a   race: Kasich: once there were 8 governors running for President and now there is only one.  —   Heather Haddon (@heatherhaddon) February 21, 2016,  10:12: Eric Cantor, ladies and gentlemen: Proud to be a @JebBush supporter  …     he’s a great American.  —   Eric Cantor (@EricCantor) February 21, 2016,  10:10: Record turnout in South Carolina: Now more than 711, 000 votes counted with 97% in.

He congratulates Messrs. Bush and Trump. He praises Jeb! as the “greatest governor in the history of Florida. ” Rubio says the “children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership. ” He says they are ready to do for the next generation “what Ronald Reagan did to us. ” Rubio talks about 21st century conservatism and and talks up Sen. Tim Scott’s story, Haley’s story, and his story. Rubio says conservatives will fight for single moms, fathers who work two jobs to give kids opportunities they never had, high school students who go to schools across towns to better their lots in life. “We will fight for you because we come from where you are now, we live the way you are living now,” Rubio says. He says the race “practically speaking” is down to three men and asks people to join his campaign because he gives the GOP the best chance to unite the party and the country. Rubio says he will always remember South Carolina as the place of “new beginnings” and “fresh start. ” [Rubio’s speech would have been a lot better had he won South Carolina like his advisers had predicted and with all of the major endorsements that he received. It seems like he is trying too hard to look like a “winner” and the speech seems like it would be better as a   act at the convention given that he hasn’t won a state yet.] 9:05: Trump: “let’s put this thing away. ” 9:02: We love our military and “We love our police. They’re not being treated properly. ” Trump says we are going to build our military so big, so powerful that “nobody is going to mess with us, folks. ” Trump says we’ll get the equipment that the general needs and not want lawmakers in Congress who are controlled by special interests tell them that they need. Trump says he is   his campaign. Trump says we’re going to take care of our vets. Crowd chants “USA! USA! USA!” after Trump says his supporters make up an “incredible movement. ” Trump says “Make America Great Again” is maybe the “greatest of all time. ” [Tony Lee: Trump is getting better with his   speeches but it has to be better, tighter.

Sanders says Clinton ran an “aggressive” and “effective” campaign and he applauds the Clinton campaign for its efforts. Sanders says his campaign is about bringing more people into he political process and again blasts the corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining democracy. He will not let billionaires and Super PACs by elections. He says the American people are catching on that we have a “rigged economy. ” He also slams the country’s broken criminal justice system. Wall Street executives whose illegal behavior destroys the economy do not get criminal records, Sanders says. His says “our job is to bring justice back to the criminal justice system. ” 6:30: Brian Williams does his best to downplay Clinton’s health concerns. He says Clinton has been trying to suppress a cough all week and her unusual coughing fit was the subject of certain websites last week. 6:22: Clinton now speaks about “systemic racism” and reforming criminal   systems. Clinton always sounds like she is lecturing when speechifying before large crowd, as if she doesn’t realize how she sounds when she tries to compete with crowd noise. Clinton says she knows what young people are up against and says it has to be about “what we’re going to build together” and not just what we give to you. Clinton says she will propose new ways for more Americans to get involved in national service. Appealing directly to minority voters: Clinton says imagine a tomorrow where “no child grows up in the shadow of discrimination and under the specter of deportation. ” [This was Clinton’s first “victory” speech without an asterisk and her husband seems just as —  if not more —  relieved than Clinton] 6:20: Taking a    shot at Sanders, Clinton says “we’re not a   country. ” 6:16: An exuberant Hillary Clinton thanks Nevada supporters. She says she is “so thrilled” and “grateful” to all of her supporters. “This one’s for you,” she says. She said her supporters turned out in every corner of the state. She said hotel and casino workers never wavered and “students with too much debt” and “small business owners who never go off the clock” all supported her. She says this is “your campaign” and it is a “campaign to break down every barrier that holds you back. ” “We hear you, we see you, we’re incredibly grateful to you,” Clinton says. Clinton says there is so much that is wrong in this country (but doesn’t mention much of what she is speaking about has occurred under Obama’s presidency). Clinton pivots to South Carolina and talks about “crumbling classrooms. ” She talks about Flint’s “poison water” that residents were forced to drink because the governor wanted to save money. She says Americans have a right to be angry and talks about wanting to get secret, unaccountable money out of politics (Clinton always says this with a straight face). She says Wall Street should not be able to threaten Main Street after saying that the next Supreme Court Justice shouldn’t let corporations buy elections. 6:15: She was for it before she was against TPP, though: Union support key to Clinton’s huge win in Nevada.

2016-02-21," The vast majority of Japanese firms are planning only modest pay raises this year, a Reuters poll showed, as murky growth prospects and turbulent markets push them to resist Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s calls for robust hikes. The Reuters Corporate Survey found 84 percent of firms expect increases of less than 2 percent as they conduct annual wage talks   a strong indication of waning momentum after   companies offered raises above that level for the past two years. The survey, conducted Feb   also found that most companies expect cumulative wage increases since a 2014 national sales tax hike to be weak, underscoring little relief for consumers who have seen their purchasing power decline. Abe has repeatedly urged Japan Inc to lift worker compensation, particularly base pay, as a key part of his strategy to drag the country out of decades of deflation, but the survey results show many companies are hesitant to commit to further rises in fixed costs. ”Unless we can become optimistic about our earnings outlook, it will be tough to lift wages,” responded a manager at a manufacturer. The survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research, polled 513 big and   firms, with managers responding on condition of anonymity. Around   firms answered questions on wages. With a global stock market rout and sharp gains in the yen coming on the heels of a quarter of economic contraction, firms have a ready excuse to forgo wage hikes and early signs from labor unions have also shown they are reducing demands. Toyota Motor Corp’s ( ) labor union is seeking a 3, 000 yen ($27) increase in monthly base pay, half of what was sought last year. That is despite the automaker expecting record profits in current financial year to March. PURCHASING POWER PAIN In Japan, annual wage talks center on levels for base pay as well as raises linked to a worker’s length of service. Until a few years ago, many   companies had simply frozen base pay levels as they are seen as hard to undo, preferring to reward employees with bonuses. Around 30 percent of companies in the survey said they did not plan to raise base pay this year, compared to just 9 percent that plan to, while the rest remain undecided. Wages in Japan fell 0. 9 percent last year in real terms, dropping for a fourth straight year. Much of the decline has been blamed on the April 2014 national sales hike to 8 percent from 5 percent, as well as rises in the cost of food and daily necessities due to a weaker yen under Abenomics.  Including plans for this year, most companies expect cumulative wage raises since the tax hike of less than 3 percent. Just over a third of firms expect wages to have climbed between 1 and 2 percent since the hike, another 22 percent expect wages to have climbed less than 1 percent while 12 percent see no wage increases at all. ”The latest results suggest cumulative wage hikes still won’t be strong enough to help households regain purchasing power,” said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, who reviewed the survey results. ”The slump in private consumption can be explained in large part by declining purchasing power. A weak yen and rising food prices in recent years have further aggravated consumer spending.” ($1 = 113. 00 yen)  (Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi Nakagawa; Editing by Edwina Gibbs) WASHINGTON New orders for U.

2016-02-22,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Among the regular cast of characters who populate the pages of Hungary’s newspapers and magazines, the one whose fame is hardest to understand, in a country long proud of its disproportionate share of Olympic medals and Nobel Prizes, may be the man usually identified simply as the prime minister’s dentist. Bela Batorfi’s rise to fame can be traced to the 2010 electoral victory of the conservative Fidesz party after eight years of Socialist Party dominance. Batorfi, then 41 years old, had a thriving practice in a posh residential corner of the capital with a clientele that included an impressive slice of the Budapest political elite. Among his longtime clients was the new prime minister, Viktor Orban, who had been his patient for almost 20 years. Orban quickly developed a reputation for ruthlessly punishing opponents and rewarding supporters, naming Fidesz loyalists to posts in the central bank and office of the chief prosecutor —  departments that had been previously immune to partisan politics. “‘Orban is putting his people everywhere,’ is a constant lament in Budapest,” the Economist itself lamented early in his term. Even the man who tended to the first family’s teeth stood to benefit. Batorfi is a specialist in oral surgery he is also the face of one of the most unexpectedly shimmering sectors of Hungary’s   economy. Between 2000 and 2008, the number of dentists in Hungary per capita increased by 56 percent. Hungary has more dentists per person than any other country, according to London journalist David Hancock, who in 2006 wrote a guide for British patients called The Complete Medical Tourist. “And since the country joined the European Union [in 2004] their fellow Europeans have had plenty to smile about, too, because prices are considerably cheaper there than in neighboring countries like Austria and Germany,” Hancock wrote. Americans Are Going to Juarez for Cheap Dental Care, By the time Orban became prime minister, medical tourism had become widely accepted by policymakers as unique tool for economic development. Its promise was almost magical: tourism for countries that had not been gifted with beaches or mountains, or had lacked the good sense millennia ago to preserve their abandoned stone structures for future sightseeing purposes. * * * Unlike Orban, Batorfi’s patients from abroad typically saw him only once or twice, if ever. Much as luck had once placed a promising young parliamentarian into Batorfi’s dental chair years before the patient would make good in politics, a fortuitous connection had introduced Batorfi to the practice of medical tourism years before the phrase meant much of anything to anyone. In 2000, Batorfi told me, a Hungarian based in England had approached him with a proposal. If he could persuade Brits to take advantage of cheap Hungarian dental work, would the dentist share with him a cut of the new business? Batorfi got a license to practice in the U. K. and rented an office in London. To his surprise, the patients started coming, adventurous types willing to confront the unfamiliar in search of prices that —  even with all travel expenses included —  typically fell below half of what they might pay in Bristol or Belfast. “In the beginning, that an English dentist would recommend a Hungarian dentist was unbelievable,” Batorfi marveled to me recently. Recognizing that foreign customers would be most likely to travel for expensive treatments where they could realize the greatest savings, Batorfi got his masters in implantology, which includes some of oral surgery’s most complex procedures. Back in Budapest, he began setting his prices in British pounds and offering free chauffeur pickup at the airport. He bought advertisements in London media. “The proof of his work and competence are the more than 35, 000 patients he has treated. Dr. Bartofi is honest and always ready to share his knowledge and expertise with his patients,” declared an ad Bartofi had placed in The Times. About a decade ago, Batorfi’s adviser Laszlo Szucs told me, Batorfi spent approximately $200, 000 to acquire four of what his adviser Szucs calls “the   of dental chairs. ” Szucs claims that there are only four other existing versions of the same model, manufactured by the Japanese company Morita: one owned by Russian President Vladimir Putin, one by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and two by a private Swedish clinic. (I could not confirm this independently.) In 2010, medical tourism had already converted Bartofi’s business from a diverse   dental practice to a     outfit, and, with his patient and friend having become head of government, he and others close to him told me he began to contemplate whether the dominant market position he had assumed could be extrapolated into a type of national comparative advantage. A 2010 study by the country’s central tax bureau estimated that the 60, 000 or so dental tourists who traveled to Hungary each year generated at least 65 billion forints (about $227 million) in revenue for dentists, with another 13 billion or so forints (about $45 million) in ancillary spending on hotels and restaurants. The sector had survived the 2009 global recession, and business showed little sign of slowing. After all, the peculiar dynamics that brought people to Batorfi’s London clinic for consultations and onward to Budapest for surgery —  a British health system that made certain types of medical care scarce, or costly, or both —  weren’t likely to yield anytime soon. “There are few things in which Hungary is in a leading position, and dental tourism is the one,” Batorfi says. When the British dental profession started to push back at the Hungarian invasion of its home turf, it started with Batorfi himself. In 2011, he was informed that the British Dental Association had suspended his license to practice dentistry in the United Kingdom for one year. Charges of malpractice were based on the testimony of a patient who had, five years earlier, traveled to Budapest for implant surgery, and details of actual damages were sketchy. (Batorfi was alleged to have given insufficient advance information about the treatment plan and, after the patient expressed dissatisfaction with the procedure, had not responded to   queries about options for corrective treatment.) A month later, after an appeal, the suspension was rescinded, but not before the prime minister’s dentist had been elevated into a national symbol of Hungary’s ability to put wealthier countries on the defensive. This helps account for Bartofi’s local celebrity: His frequent appearances in Hungarian media are most often in connection with political intrigue. When, in his second year in office, Orban invited dental businesses to bid for a series of government contracts, Batorfi entered and ultimately won everything for which he appeared to be eligible. Over the first four years of Orban’s administration, 3 billion forints in contracts and state aid —  about $10 million —  flowed from Hungary’s federal government to companies and trade associations under Bartofi’s influence. “Batorfi has been Orban’s dentist since 1992,” Szucs told the news magazine Heti Vilaggazdasag, defending his client’s right to bid. “Why wouldn’t he enter into a competition when any other business could compete?” Announcing a major grant to the dental tourism sector at a Budapest conference in 2012, Orban called it “a worthy and good investment. ” (In a country that has struggled to deliver quality health coverage to all its citizens, however, the fact that the most lucrative part of Hungarian health care was a gaudily extravagant sector that existed largely to serve foreigners’ vanities might look to some citizens like a failure of government.) The financial commitment was a bet that medical tourism was more than a fad —  that what had very quickly shown Hungary to be effective at luring travelers to seek medical care wasn’t just the consequence of a few talented dentists emerging at the right time, or of Batorfi’s entrepreneurial instincts. Had Hungary made itself good at something that would last? After officially winning the public contract to determine how that “worthy and good investment” would be spent, Batorfi turned to yet another one of his patients for help. Laszlo Szucs was a communications consultant based in Budapest whom Batorfi had informally asked for marketing advice in between visits to the dental chair for years. When Batorfi had first put Szucs on his payroll, in 2009, Szucs was in Napa Valley, working on a short documentary about a   winemaker Mike Grgich, whose Chateau Montelena Chardonnay famously won the 1976 Judgment of Paris competition, establishing California wines as a formidable product with a distinct identity in the global marketplace. Szucs and Miklos Rozsa, a business consultant, began thinking about their product in similar terms. “Our aim is,” Rozsa told me, “in Switzerland, you get chocolates and watches. In Hungary, you get dentistry. ” This article has been adapted from Sasha Issenberg’s new book, Outpatients: The Astonishing New World of Medical Tourism."
2016-02-23," The Charlotte City Council passed an LGBT nondiscrimination bill on Monday night in a 7 to 4 vote  —   despite North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory issuing a stern warning that the state may intervene to negate the city’s vote. Gov. McCrory had said state lawmakers could take “immediate” action to block the law in a Sunday email to city officials. Contacted by BuzzFeed News, his office declined to speculate on what action the legislature would take, and leaders in the state house and senate did not immediately comment. But several sources told BuzzFeed News the state could follow in the steps of Arkansas, where legislators passed a bill last year that preempts local jurisdictions from enacting nondiscrimination policies that extend beyond state law. That sort of clash in North Carolina could tee up a rancorous partisan showdown that pits a state capitol run by Republicans against city hall controlled by Democrats. Furthermore, it could make Charlotte the latest flashpoint for the national LGBT movement, which has struggled to pass nondiscrimination laws since winning marriage equality at the Supreme Court last year. The Charlotte ordinance, which is slated to take effect in April, bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression in housing and places of public accommodation. (State law does not allow cities to ban workplace discrimination.) Charlotte City Councilmember John Autry supported the measure, telling BuzzFeed News before the vote it protects vulnerable citizens from discrimination. But if the state tried to challenge the law, he said, “We have no legal leg to contest it with. ” Autry said North Carolina law empowers the state with strong control over jurisdictions, allowing it to “preempt our authority. If the state wanted to, they could come here to the government center, fire all of us, send us home, and run the city themselves. ” We have a full house. Lots of people heading to the overflow space. #cltequality #clt #citycouncil, More than 100 people packed a council hearing before the vote.   Christian conservatives, many furious, expressed fear the nondiscrimination law would allow transgender people  —   and men posing as trans  —   to sexually assault women in restrooms. They also worried about their religious freedom, saying the bill would force them to promote LGBT values in violation of their faith. One man  —   dressed up as a king and waving a scepter  —   mocked transgender people by proclaiming, “I identify as gender royal   …     Anyone who does not bow and call me your highness shall be fined. ” When the man refused to stop yelling, Mayor Jennifer Roberts threatened to have him removed from the room. She also asked   speakers to show “human decency. ” One woman compared transgender people to someone who thinks they are a bird or cat, while another compared transgender people to drivers traveling the wrong direction on freeways. In contrast, a transgender woman told the council she was afraid to be there, while others said LGBT rights were part of a   civil rights movement. Supporters of the bill said perverted characterizations of transgender people only underscored the need to protect transgender people from discrimination. “Conservative people, led by a lot of religious factions, have tried to characterize transgender people as sex offenders, perverts, pedophiles, or all of the above,” Councilmember Autry said in phone call before the vote. “Show me the evidence that supports your assertion. I haven’t seen it. I think it’s about discrimination, and if you can deny the rights of our most vulnerable citizens, then you can just as easily work to deny the rights of other factions. ” There are no documented cases in the 17 states and 225 other cities with such laws on the books of people using the policies for nefarious purposes, but the bathroom attack has been a potent argument for blocking and repealing LGBT nondiscrimination laws. Last fall voters in Houston, Texas, repealed the city’s nondiscrimination bill and just this month the city council in Jacksonville, Florida, withdrew a similar bill. The assembly in Anchorage, Alaska, passed a similar law and citizens are attempted to repeal it. In all of those cities, as in Charlotte, critics hammered on a message that the nondiscrimination ordinance would allow transgender women  —   who they tend to describe as men  —   to sexually prey in women by claiming they are protected on the basis of gender identity in public restrooms and locker rooms. That was also a leading argument in South Dakota, which last week became the first state to pass a bill banning transgender students from using restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity. The bill awaits the governor’s signature. In North Carolina, Gov. McCrory contended in his email that the ordinance tried “to solve a problem that does not exist,” adding that the bill may create “major public safety issues by   …     allowing a person with male anatomy, for example, to use a female restroom. ” The bathroom issue was also flashpoint in Charlotte last year, when the council narrowly rejected a similar bill. Since then, two Democrats on the council who voted against the bill were replaced by Democrats who voted yes on Monday. Equality North Carolina, an advocacy group, had helped support   candidates. It’s unclear how soon the the state could attempt to override Charlotte’s law. The General Assembly, which is currently out of session, could hold an extra session or take up the issue when they reconvene in spring. One state lawmaker, Rep. Dan Bishop, sent city officials a letter this month claiming the city lacked legal authority to pass a nondiscrimination ordinance because the state never delegated that power to municipalities.  "
2016-02-24,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Spanish. French. German. Computer coding. Are they the same? This question is at the center of a debate in Florida, where legislators are currently considering a bill that would require high schools to offer computer coding as a   credit. The bill is sponsored by the former Yahoo executive and democratic state senator Jeremy Ring, who sees coding as its own unique language. But some argue the skill doesn’t offer the value of   training and might be a better fit for the STEM disciplines. Last December, the   County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said he “absolutely” disagrees with the idea that computer coding is an equal substitute for a foreign language. (So do the editorial staffs of the Tampa Bay Times, Tallahassee Democrat, Orlando Sentinel and The Palm Beach Post.) Research out of the University of Florida suggests most Floridians believe Spanish instruction should be required in the state’s schools.   County, where more than 66 percent of residents are Hispanic or Latino, is home to the largest school district in Florida and the sixth largest in the U. S. Recently, the district pledged to improve its   instruction with better teacher training and a new curriculum. “Based on both educational, intellectual development, and emotional development —  as well as   economic development in an increasingly bilingual and biliterate community —  computer coding is not a ” Carvalho told the Miami Herald. Bills similar to Ring’s have passed or been introduced in other states, with proponents claiming the    approach will benefit students who will need to compete in the   workforce. “By 2020, companies across the U. S. will have 1. 4 million job openings requiring   expertise and just 400, 000 college graduates to fill them,” John Lauerman writes for Bloomberg Business. But, as a source tells Lauerman, monolingual Americans will need to up their game, too. Mari Corugedo, who teaches     learners in the   district, knows this firsthand. “In our case, in   many of the jobs do require them to have the language of Spanish in order to communicate and do business here,” she said in a phone interview Monday. While teaching her students English, she also works with them to maintain proficiency in their first language so that by the time they graduate from high school, they are confident in both. Corugedo is also a district director for League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) Florida, which opposes the bill. In a widely cited Code. org post related to this issue, the author Amy Hirotaka writes: Although we use the term “programming language” to refer to C++ Java, Python, and so on, these aren’t natural languages. Spanish has a vocabulary of 10, 000 words, with a consistent grammatical and sentence structure. In contrast, a typical computing language has a vocabulary of about 100 words, and the real work is learning how to put these words together to build a complex program. Another concern Floridians have: Who’s going to teach these courses if the bill passes? Gloria   the director of the Office of Teacher Preparation and Accreditation at the University of Miami, said the state is already facing a teacher shortage. So if every high school in the state is required to hire a teacher who can code, that could be a challenge —  one that also affects   programs at the   level. There’s also the question of whether students who take coding as their foreign language in high school will be accepted into colleges and universities that are looking for credits earned in traditional   courses. The Florida bill addresses this, stating that colleges and universities within the state system must accept computer coding as a foreign language. However, “each student and his or her parent must sign a statement acknowledging and accepting that taking a   course as a foreign language may not meet    college and university   requirements. ” The Florida Senate will reconvene Tuesday, with the bill on its special order calendar. If enacted, the bill would take effect on July 1 and would require schools to start offering   courses by the   school year. This article appears courtesy of the Education Writers Association."
2016-02-25,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla.  —   Florida State officials have suspended the school’s Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity following a police investigation into hazing allegations. The university reported in a news release Wednesday that the complaint was filed in January through the school’s hazing website. The TKE member said pledges were forced to participate in a drinking game called “Old South,” where they were made to act as slaves. They were also left stranded more than 150 miles from the Tallahassee campus. The graduate told police he waited until after graduating in December to report the 2013 incident. Local prosecutors told university police too much time had passed to file charges, but school officials are investigating possible student conduct violations. A statement from TKE’s national chapter said they’re taking the allegations seriously, and they don’t tolerate racism."
2016-02-26,"The GOP debate in Houston on Thursday night was arguably Donald J. Trump’s worst of the entire 2016 campaign. He allowed Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) to mock him, and hurled insults while Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) took the high road. Rubio’s supporters are justifiably gleeful, and Cruz’s supporters were reassured to see him win on home turf. [Yes, Trump lost —  but he also won. And not just because of online polls, or Chris Christie’s endorsement Friday.  Trump won because Rubio and Cruz each found a reason to stay in the race. So they will continue splitting the vote, allowing Trump to stay on top. Trump mocks the idea that if his rivals combined their votes, they could defeat him. As other candidates drop out, he notes, at least some of those votes will come to him. Yet Trump consistently loses in    contests. If the Republican Party could consolidate behind Rubio or Cruz, Trump could still lose. Whether because each sincerely believes he can win, or is too vain to yield to the other, Rubio and Cruz have failed to solve this puzzle. Cruz has suffered three   finishes in a row, but he has a good chance of winning two of the twelve Super Tuesday states (Texas and Arkansas) while Rubio leads in none. Conversely, while Cruz claims that he is the only candidate who can beat Trump, only Rubio has made him bleed. Rubio has also racked up a set of big endorsements. On the other hand, Cruz has much of the conservative media. Neither feels an urgency to quit. Nor do their supporters show any eagerness to reconcile. In fact, they may dislike each other more than they dislike Trump. Cruz supporters will never let Rubio forget the Gang of Eight, and Rubio fans consider Cruz unelectable. If Rubio had done less well Thursday, or Cruz had collapsed, Trump would be in trouble. Instead, he won by losing."
2016-02-27,"Rick Tyler, the former communications director for Sen. Ted Cruz’s ( ) presidential campaign who was fired this week over a misleading video, told MSNBC on Friday that he did not realize how much attention the video would get when he posted it to social media. Tyler posted a video to Twitter and Facebook that appeared to show Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) saying that there are ”not many answers” in the Bible. Rubio actually said that ”all the answers” are in the Bible. Tyler removed the video when he realized the error and apologized, but Cruz ultimately asked Tyler to resign. Tyler, who has now become an MSNBC contributor, said on Friday that he was ”not mad” that he was let go. MSNBC’s Chuck Todd asked Tyler if he was fired because Cruz was disappointed in him or because ”they had accumulated too much baggage.” ”No, he was disappointed, and it was a bad call in judgment. And look, I believe Marco Rubio is a   Christian. I had no doubt about that when I tweeted it,” Tyler replied. ”Part of my judgment is I didn’t realize how much that would be twisted up and blown up, and it was. But it shouldn’t have been done. I shouldn’t have done it, and I regretted doing it. And I went on national television and told Sen. Rubio I was sorry about it.” Despite Cruz’s disappointment in Tyler, the former spokesman said that he left the campaign with a fond farewell. ”In fact, the whole team to a person went out that night to sort of wish me farewell and goodbye, including Jeff Roe, the campaign manager,” Tyler said on MSNBC. ”And Jeff made everybody tell a funny Rick Tyler story, so it was a little like being at your own funeral.” Watch the interview via MSNBC: "
2016-02-28," LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas  —   Ted Cruz released four years’ worth of tax returns on Saturday, two days after promising to do so during the debate on Thursday. He released only the first two pages of his tax returns for each year, though. The returns show that Cruz and his wife Heidi Cruz made $1. 2 million in 2014 and paid $442, 701 in taxes. They do not indicate how much the Cruzes spent in charitable contributions, and do not show how much of the Cruz family’s income has come from Heidi Cruz, a Goldman Sachs investment manager who is currently on leave during the campaign. Speaking to reporters on Saturday night ahead of a rally hosted here by   super PAC Keep the Promise, Cruz pointed out that he has now released nine years of tax returns total and said after being asked by reporters that he would release the full returns, and not just the   summaries, if his rivals do the same. Cruz released his full tax returns for the previous five years in 2012 during his Senate race. “The first five years, we released the complete tax returns,” Cruz said. “The latest four, we released the summary pages really to match what the other competitors have done. ” “If Marco wants to release the complete things for the recent years I’m happy to do so as well, and I would certainly encourage Donald Trump to do it, but we just did it to match what the other candidates are doing, this is a competitive race,” Cruz said. Previously on Saturday, Rubio also released partial tax returns. He reportedly said later on Saturday night that he will release his full returns as well. Cruz said it raises “serious ethical issues” that Donald Trump has not released any tax returns. Cruz referenced Mitt Romney’s suggestion that there could be a “bombshell” in Trump’s returns, and speculated that it could be that Trump is “embarrassed” to reveal that he isn’t as rich as he says he is, or that he is worried about legal exposure for the years for which he is being audited. (Trump said during the debate on Thursday that he doesn’t want to release his returns because he is being audited, though he didn’t know exactly which years). Cruz also raised the question of whether there could be “irregularities” or “fraud. ” “If he had tax irregularities, if he had any issues of tax fraud,” Cruz said. “Hilary Clinton and the Democrats aided and abetted by the press would make it a major issue in the general election. ” Cruz also speculated that Trump may have donated to “  organizations. ” “It could be that Donald Trump is not nearly as wealthy as he tells everybody he is,” Cruz said. “A lot of people, a lot of reporters, a lot of media outlets have speculated that his claims of wealth are vastly inflated. ” Asked about whether he has made charitable contributions  —   something that isn’t evident from what the campaign has released  —   Cruz said, “I’ve made very substantial charitable contributions. ” The fact that Cruz didn’t tithe in past years became an issue in the   to the Iowa caucuses, where Mike Huckabee allies made ads centering around the issue. Cruz campaigned in Georgia, Alabama, and Arkansas on Saturday and will be in Oklahoma and Texas in the next two days before Super Tuesday, the day that Cruz has cast in heightened terms as the most important day of his entire campaign. Though Cruz has been criticizing Trump on a regular basis for weeks after spending months avoiding going negative on him, it is Rubio who has gotten the most attention for his Trump attacks in the days since the debate. Rubio, who previously had not laid a hand on Trump, has made fun of Trump’s tan, suggested that he wet his pants, and mocked him for misspelling words. Cruz has repeatedly in the past promised not to engage in personal insults with regard to Trump, but he appears to see the tax return issue as a potent way to needle Trump and cast doubt on his integrity.  "
2016-02-29,"Fans of Marco Rubio are rejoicing: Their man is finally giving Donald Trump a taste of his own medicine. Here’s Rubio on Trump’s, ahem, “unnatural” complexion: “The guy with the worst spray tan in America is attacking me for putting on makeup. Donald Trump likes to sue people. He should sue whoever did that to his face. . . . Donald is not going to make America great, he’s going to make America orange. ” On misspelled words in Trump’s tweets: “That’s how they spell at the Wharton School of Business. . . . He must have hired a foreign worker to do his own tweets. ” On a   heckler: “Ladies and gentlemen, the valedictorian of Trump University!” RELATED: Trump, the   Candidate, If anyone has it coming, it’s Trump. He’s made a whole campaign of dishing such insults out now we’re watching him take them. And the same media outlets that gleefully aired Trump’s   rallies live for most of 2015 have no standing to lament the coarsening of American public discourse now. The disgusting symbiosis between Trump and   programmers has defined this election Rubio’s just belatedly decided to play by their rules. Nevertheless, it’s worth asking how this particular genie could ever be put back in the bottle. Share article on FacebookshareTweet The networks have made it pretty clear that they’ll take their eye off Trump only as long as Rubio is insulting him. As soon as Rubio returns to his standard campaign speech  —   to the ideas and policies that elections are supposed to be about  —   they cut away to the studio, or back to the moment’s Trump rally. RELATED: It’s Trump’s World. We’re All Just Enabling It. And Ted Cruz, who refuses to emulate Don Rickles in criticizing Trump, has virtually disappeared from the news cycle. Cruz has been as critical as Rubio last week he said, “I’m not willing gamble my daughters’ future with Donald Trump. If Donald Trump became president, nobody knows what the heck he would do. He doesn’t know what the heck he would do. ” But that line just wasn’t funny or shocking enough to generate many headlines. It’s still possible for Rubio to overcome Trump or deny him the delegates needed for the nomination, but this should provide little comfort to those of us who actually care about the direction of the country. If Rubio wins, it will be in part because he adapted to the   circus that modern political journalism prizes above all else. If Rubio and Cruz lose, it will be in part because Cruz wasn’t willing to play the insult game and Rubio started it too late. But then, everything about the GOP’s reaction to Trump came too late. In September, when he mocked Carly Fiorina’s appearance, he gave party leaders a clear opportunity to declare that those kinds of comments were completely unacceptable from an aspiring  . They failed to seize that opportunity, and the countless other similar openings Trump would later provide them. More Donald Trump A Question Needing an AnswerIs Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? You gotta have heart, c. The rise of such a crass and obnoxious candidate reflects the fact that America has a crass and obnoxious culture. In some circles, it’s considered shallow to judge people by their appearance. In others, it’s the    final word that resolves the argument. Trump called Fox News’s Megyn Kelly a “bimbo,” declared Heidi Klum is no longer a “ten,” wrote Gail Collins to tell her she has the face of a dog, and said Arianna Huffington is “a dog who wrongfully comments on me. ” He’s the comments section personified: sneering, swearing, lashing out. His base has applauded all the while, and that’s the truly worrisome thing: Our political culture is so toxic because just enough of us like it that way.,"
2016-03-01,"We all know ancestors give us our hair color, but the roots of gray hair have been less clear. Is it genetics, or stress? Marie Antoinette supposedly went completely white the night before they lopped off her head. And our presidents seem to go gray much faster than those of us with less weighty roles. It turns out you can blame Mom and Dad, at least a bit. Scientists say they’ve identified the first gene for gray hair. The variant, dubbed IRF4, is also associated with blonde or   hair. That makes sense, because melanin is the pigment that paints hair with the chestnut, golden or raven hues of youth. With age, the melanocytes that produce the color in hair follicles can slow down. And you start going gray. ”You think about hair graying as the absence of melanin,” says Kaustubh Adhikari, a statistical genetics postdoc at University College London and lead author of the study, which was published Tuesday in Nature Communications. Gray hair is more common in people of European origin, as is lighter hair. That makes sense, Adhikari says. ”You would sort of think of hair graying as an unintended consequence of selecting for this hair color.” In other words, if you decide to marry a blonde, don’t be surprised if your kids someday turn gray. People of Asian and African ancestry also go gray, but less often than do Europeans. ”You would expect that they would have genes that influence graying,” Adhikari says. ”We just haven’t found them yet.” The scientists discovered the gray gene by studying the scalps and facial hair of 6, 630 volunteers in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. The researchers took photographs and asked about natural hair color. The participants had a mix of European, Native American and African ancestry. Then the scientists performed genetic analyses called   association scans that look for common variants, and matched them with appearance. Ten new variants popped out gray hair was matched with one. Others influence unibrow, balding, eyebrow thickness and hair structure. Still, genetics isn’t necessarily destiny. Adhikari figures that the IRF4 variant accounts for about 30 percent of gray hair, with environmental factors  —   including, perhaps, stress  —   accounting for the rest."

2016-03-03,"Allegations of sexual assault against Bill Cosby as well as intensified focus on campus rape have left many prosecutors struggling to figure out new ways to right old wrongs. Now, a growing number of states are changing their statutes of limitations to allow sexual assault cases to be prosecuted years and even decades after the fact. ”We have to keep the door open for justice for survivors,” says Rebecca O’Connor from the Rape, Abuse And Incest National Network. State statutes of limitations currently range from 3 to 30 years. O’Connor says a new understanding about how rape victims often need time to recover from their trauma is bolstering efforts to loosen their time limits. ”It has been nonstop, the public outrage and awareness about access to justice. That’s really been mushrooming,” she says. Several states, including Florida and Nevada, have lengthened their time limits. More than a   more, are actively considering it, and many states have no limit at all for cases where there’s DNA evidence or for the most serious rapes. Virginia is one of those with an   policy. It’s what allowed one woman just this week to go to the police and report a rape that she says happened at a small college on her 19th birthday 19 years ago. ”I was staying overnight in someone’s dorm room and was starting to fall asleep and a stranger walked in that I never had met before and in my mind he knew what he was going in there to do and he made it happen,” she says. The woman, who asked that her name not be used to protect her privacy, says she told school security and a school nurse what happened but she was so traumatized and in such deep denial for years that she didn’t even consider telling police she was raped. ”I didn’t even recognize it as that. I minimized it in my mind and I just kinda blew it off that it was a bad night because I just wanted to believe that it didn’t happen,” she says. Now she says going to police is not only important to her own healing but also, as her lawyer and founder of the advocacy group SurvJustice Laura Dunn says, it’s a matter of public safety. ”Every single state has an interest in making sure that individuals who are predatory are taken off the street and if that means someone speaking out later, that’s something we should be supporting,” Dunn says. But how much later is the subject of fierce debate. Gerry Morris of the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys says its wrong to totally eliminate time limits, or to make them, as he puts it, ”ridiculously long.” ”How would I mount a defense to an accusation of something that occurred two decades ago or is that person just basically a sitting duck at this point?” he asks. Morris says time limits were enacted for a reason: memories fade, evidence gets lost and witnesses are hard to find. But Cardoza Law School professor Marci Hamilton says defendents have ample protections at trial, and the prosecutors have the bigger challenge  —   to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Concerns about wrongful convictions are unfounded, she says. ”Prosecutors winnow out the cases where they think they can’t win, and so there’s a natural fault in the system where weak cases simply are not picked up for prosecution,” she says. A bill approved by lawmakers this week in Oregon aims for a middle ground by differentiating between weak and stronger cases. All cases have a   window for prosecution. But the limit is lifted in cases where there is hard evidence, for example, or multiple accusers. The sponsor, State Sen. Floyd Prozanski, says he was pilloried by some advocates for not supporting longer windows for all cases. But as a guy who was traumatized himself by the murder of his sister in high school, Prozanski knows how emotion can lead to bad decisions. ”I literally was wanting to grab one of my hunting guns and go hunt the guy down. But the reality is when we’re in these situations, we have to take away these emotions and we can’t just basically say we’re going to just remove any safeguards that we currently have,” Prozanski says. Experts say the next step might be to open doors wider for civil cases, so even when an alleged victim misses the deadline for prosecution, an alleged perpetrator would still not be totally off the hook."

2016-03-05,"In 2009, pro soccer player Lyle Martin was playing for the Vancouver White Caps, in a North American league below Major League Soccer, when he got talking with a teammate about his future. The teammate introduced him to an agent who floated the idea of playing in China. ”I was like, ’China? !’” Martin says. ”Are we talking about the same place?” At the time, the Chinese Super League barely registered as a blip on global soccer radar and no American had ever played professionally in the league. But Martin wanted to make more money, and CSL teams were cutting much bigger checks. So he signed with one and moved to China in 2010. ”I was getting a very good salary in comparison to major league players over here,” Martin said. ”In bonuses alone, maybe in a month or two months, I could make more than I made playing in the [United Soccer League] for two or three years.”   six years. The CSL  —   which just kicked off its season  —   is now signing international stars for enormous sums, and the world is taking notice. Last month, CSL team Jiangsu Suning outbid storied English Premiere League club Liverpool to sign Brazilian striker Alex Teixiera. Asked about the transfer, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said: ”People in football talk about the financial power of England because of the television contract and things like this, and now maybe [China] is another competitor.” In fact, the Chinese Super League smashed its   record several times this winter. In late January, Jiangsu Suning paid $31 million to sign former Chelsea midfielder Ramires. A week later, a different Chinese team, Guangzhou Evergrande, dropped $46 million to sign Jackson Martinez from Spanish club giant Atlético Madrid. And when Jiangsu Suning signed Teixiera for a breathtaking $55 million, the soccer world’s collective jaw hit the floor. ”When I was over there, they were spending at that time  —   I thought  —   a ton of money,” says Martin, who played in China from  . ”But when I see it now, it’s just like, ’Well, I guess they were spending peanuts before.’ ” During this season’s winter transfer window, the CSL spent about $65 million more than the English Premiere League, which perennially trumps spending by the other four top European leagues: Spain’s La Liga, Germany’s Bundesliga, Italy’s Serie A and France’s Ligue 1. The wave of huge spending is China’s latest step in its bid to become a global soccer power. With the backing of President Xi Jinping, an avowed soccer fan, and no shortage of investment money, the country has the political will and naked ambition to propel soccer into a starring role on the world stage. Last year, Xi announced a   plan to overhaul all levels of soccer and help revitalize the ”Chinese Dream”  —   which Xi says is to build a ”moderately prosperous society in all respects” and realize China’s ”ascendance to military, economic, and cultural power.” A robust soccer culture in China, the thinking goes, could help marshal national pride, serve as a   tool in Chinese diplomacy and rev the country’s economic engine. According to Forbes, China wants to nearly double the portion of its GDP coming from sports, which lags the U. S. and many other countries. Consulting firm PwC has estimated total revenues from 2015 ticketing, media rights, sponsorship and merchandising in China to be $3. 4 billion. By comparison, the U. S. figure was $63. 6 billion. Spurred on by the government, Chinese investors are opening their wallets to kickstart growth both domestically and internationally. Last October, the   investment firm China Media Capital bought exclusive   broadcast rights to the CSL for about $250 million per year. That sum pales in comparison to the $7   broadcasters paid for rights to the current English Premiere League season, but dwarfs U. S. broadcasters’ $75    deal with Major League Soccer. Investment in club ownership, too, has increased. In 2014, Alibaba Group Holding, owned by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, bought a 50 percent stake in Guangzhou Evergrande for $192 million. (It now owns about 40 percent.) Last year, Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin, who owns the real estate company Dalian Wanda, bought a 20 percent stake in Atlético Madrid for $52 million, with the stated intention of using the connection to improve Chinese soccer. ”This investment will not only provide a golden opportunity for young Chinese players sent overseas by Wanda to be selected by leading European football clubs, it will also strengthen the quality of Chinese football and narrow the gap between the rest of the world,” Wang said in a statement. Despite the recent fervor around Chinese soccer, the professional game in China isn’t new. China’s first pro league was established in 1994  —   just a year after the MLS began in the U. S.  —   and transitioned into its current format, the   Super League, in 2004. John Duerden, a South   British journalist who has been writing about Asian soccer since 2002, says soccer has always been a major sport in China. ”One misconception is that it’s come from nothing. . .. It was always a decent Asian league, decent standing with quite reasonable attendances,” Duerden says. ”Chinese football has a long history, and there is a love of the game.” Just ask Liu Qiang, a    manager in the entertainment industry who lives in Beijing and says he has been following both Chinese soccer and European leagues since he was a teenager. ”Of course my favorite [team] is Beijing Guoan,” he says, referring to the city’s Super League club. ”I mainly watch the Premier League. It is better organized and has more   players. But in terms of soccer culture, Guoan is irreplaceable in my mind. Because it’s from my hometown.” Liu bought season tickets last year and describes the stadium atmosphere as ”overwhelming.” ”In the middle of the game,” he says, ”fans will jump up and down, yelling to show support. We call it ’unbeatable home court.’ ” Martin, who is still the only American to have played in the Super League, says he was blown away by the fan support. ”When we would go to training sessions, there would be anywhere from 8, 000 to 10, 000 people watching. . .. For me, it was a shock at first I’m not used to that, people don’t recognize me,” he says. ”I never thought of myself as a star in the game. I was just always a player that worked hard. . .. They would always want to take pictures and get autographs  —   the fans were beyond great.” As for the game itself, Martin says his Chinese counterparts weren’t as strong or fast as the U. S. players he was used to facing, but calls them ”technical geniuses.” Fans in China, too, note the difference between the level of play in the Super League and in the top European Leagues they watch. One of them is Liu Yang, a    designer and program organizer in Beijing who follows the EPL, La Liga and CSL. He says the Chinese league is ”less exciting” compared with the five big leagues in Europe. ”European leagues are more confrontational, more skillful in passing. The Super League is weaker in this regard,” he says. Still, he says he enjoys the CSL and supports two of its clubs. ”One is Beijing Guoan. I’m a Beijinger, so of course I support our own soccer club. Another team is Guangzhou Evergrande because they’ve been doing great for the past few years,” he says. Much of Guangzhou Evergrande’s success is due to the fact that it was the first CSL club to really spend big. It had been relegated to a lower league in 2010 as punishment for   Duerden says. But the club got a new investor, Evergrande Real Estate Group, and climbed back to the top of the table, winning the country’s first Asian Football Confederation Champions League title in 2013. ”At the moment, people write about the political will to see that China becomes a world power in football, which obviously is part of it,” Duerden says, ”but you see teams now who want to catch the champions and win things themselves, so it’s a competition domestically to get better and better players.” Li Jianning, a    program planner in Beijing, says signing talented foreign players ”brings immediate effect for Chinese clubs.” He says, ”It helps to present more competitive games and therefore attracts more audience.” Both Liu Yang and Liu Qiang agree, saying skilled foreigners help elevate local players and build both the fan base and global brand awareness of the Chinese Super League. In the U. S. Major League Soccer is banking on a similar strategy by signing players such as Didier Drogba, David Villa, Kaká and Andrea Pirlo. But to field a championship club team in China (and eventually a strong national team) it’s clear that the CSL must focus on improving Chinese players. In the Super League, only four players from   countries per team are permitted to be on the field at any given time to ensure that domestic players have enough opportunities to develop. This, Duerden says, is the ”key to everything.” ”Of course, the ultimate aim is to do well on the international level with national teams in the Asian cups and then the World Cups, and not only qualify for World Cups, but . .. ultimately win them,” he says. ”But this is going to take time.” Given the government interest, investor enthusiasm and the country’s potential fan base of nearly 1. 4 billion people, the global success of Chinese soccer might seem inevitable. But it’s all a matter of perspective  —   just ask the fans. ”I think we’ve already have a   club now: Guangzhou Evergrande,” Li Jianning says, citing the club’s No. 40 world ranking in 2013, which put it above a number of European clubs. Liu Yang says evaluating the future of Chinese soccer is about managing expectations: ”The Super League is way weaker [than European leagues]. I believe it has the potential to be the best in Asia, but when it comes to worldwide, it’s not practical.” But Liu Qiang thinks China’s passion for the game will help propel its rise internationally. ”I think it’s because since a long time ago, Chinese people all share this dream about Chinese soccer, which is ’Go beyond Asia, Take on the world! ’”   NPR News Assistant Liang Ruixue contributed to this report."
2016-03-06," Sunday’s Democratic debate was notable not for who was onstage, but for who was in the audience. The debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders took place in Flint, Michigan  —   a city whose water supply has been contaminated with shocking amounts of lead, where local officials dismissed and covered up the water problems, and where residents were lied to and ignored.    Tonight, residents of Flint told Clinton and Sanders about their struggles with the water crisis, as well as preexisting issues from underemployment to public education, and demanded to know what they would do. That isn’t something that typically happens on national television, and it was for that reason remarkable. But it was also, of course, a Democratic presidential debate  —   in which the candidates tried to improve their positions for the rest of the campaign to come. So here’s who ended tonight’s debate having accomplished their objectives, and who ended up falling short. Winner: Bernie Sanders            Bernie Sanders’s supporters have long argued that the candidate’s relative weakness with nonwhite voters (and particularly   voters) has a simple cause: name recognition. Once they learn who he is and what he stands for, the argument goes, they’ll get on board.    Tonight’s debate showed there’s some merit to that argument. The heavily black audience responded extremely well to Sanders, especially during the first section of the debate, which dealt with Flint in particular. Where Clinton came off as a levelheaded technocrat  —   the person she thinks you’d want in charge in a crisis  —   Sanders’s debate answers reflected the same anger and betrayal heard in questions from the audience.    Racially speaking, Sanders did make one   misstep: appearing to assume that African Americans lived in ”the ghetto.” But in general, he appeared more comfortable speaking about race and racism than he ever has before, and his answers were as strong as they’ve ever been. Sanders didn’t land any major new attacks on Clinton. And it’s unlikely that a single debate is going to eliminate his deficit with   voters, much less spur him to catch Clinton on delegates (something that is looking increasingly impossible). But anyone who did tune in to Bernie Sanders for the first time tonight got a very good first impression.    Winner: Hillary Clinton             Look. We know it is ridiculous to say that in a   debate, both candidates are winners. But think of it this way: The two candidates’ goals were totally different. Sanders needed to demonstrate that he could fully fold his racial justice message into his economic populism and become the candidate of the progressive movement as a whole. Doing this was important not just to his 2016 candidacy, but to his future as a   for progressivism. Clinton, meanwhile, is the increasingly prohibitive favorite for the nomination. The delegate math simply favors her tremendously. So the most important thing she could do in tonight’s debate    Bernie Sanders was avoid saying anything so tremendously, galactically stupid that she would sabotage her own success.    Instead, Clinton needed to have a debate with Sanders that both engaged Sanders and would be appealing to a general election audience. She managed to do both of those things by emphasizing her pragmatism, attention to detail, and   skills  —   the sort of   hypercompetence she loves to project. That made it harder for her to connect with the Flint audience during the first section of the debate. But it allowed her to play to her strengths when arguing with Sanders over the auto bailout. Ironically, Sanders did a better job of delivering the message that ”sometimes you have to vote for the bad things in a bill to get the good things” when he was defending his vote on the crime bill than Clinton did when she was defending her vote on the bailout  —   but it’s a better argument for Clinton’s candidacy than it is for Sanders’s. Winner: Flint, Michigan            Hillary Clinton made a huge promise to a mother in Flint who wanted to know what Clinton would do as president to solve Flint’s lead crisis. Clinton’s answer is good news for Flint and for the communities all over the United States grappling with lead poisoning that Flint represents. Clinton vowed to eliminate lead in soil, paint, and water in the US within five years. This plan could easily cost a trillion dollars to accomplish. Just getting rid of lead pipes would cost $290 billion, according to a recent estimate. Still, the response highlighted how the Flint water crisis has put a new focus on the devastating effects of lead on children’s health. The remedies Clinton and Sanders endorsed for the problems in Flint were less sweeping: more federal funding, monitoring from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and an investigation into what the Environmental Protection Agency knew and when. But that’s partly because the damage from lead poisoning is irreversible, and so what can be done for the people of Flint is therefore limited as well. Still, the importance placed on Flint was a sharp contrast with Thursday’s Republican debate in nearby Detroit, where Sen. Marco Rubio briefly answered one question about the crisis late in the evening by arguing that it shouldn’t be ”politicized” since no one had intended to poison the water on purpose.    Merely keeping Flint in the national spotlight is a win for the city as well. It’s been five months since the scope of the lead poisoning crisis was first revealed, and three months since it became a story of broad national interest. Hosting the debate in Flint and pressing the candidates with questions about what they’d do about lead poisoning keeps Flint front and center. However limited the federal remedies are, the chance of them happening will drop the moment the nation moves on to the next tragedy or outrage. Loser: Don Lemon             One of the most interesting arguments in the Democratic primary has been about the best approach to addressing institutional oppression of African Americans in the United States. CNN in general, and Don Lemon in particular, had an opportunity to get into this argument. Not only did they miss that opportunity, but they reverted back to a much more superficial argument over racism that the Democratic Party has recently moved past. Sanders’s approach to systemic racism is consistent with the economic populism of his campaign. He’s argued that the problems facing the black poor are an intense version of the problems facing struggling families of all races around the country  —   and sees expanding youth employment, for example, as one way to end mass incarceration. Clinton, on the other hand, has recently emphasized systemic racism as a different kind of oppression, independent of economic inequality. During a speech in Harlem in February, she made a statement that could sum up the last month of her campaign: ”We face a complex set of economic, social, and political challenges. They are intersectional, they are reinforcing, and we have got to take them all on.” CNN was interested in questions about the candidates’ personal feelings and experiences. First, a Flint resident asked what experiences Sanders had that helped him ”understand the mindset of other cultures.” Then Don Lemon asked Clinton what her personal racial blind spots were, with a reference to ”Everyone’s a Little Bit Racist,” the (kind of racist) song from the Broadway musical Avenue Q. Then when she gave an answer that talked about broader forms of racism, he asked the question again.    It was one of the more awkward examples we’ve seen during this campaign of the axiom that the questions debate moderators think are ”tough” are often bad questions. Hillary Clinton’s personal racial blind spots, or Bernie Sanders’s personal experiences with other cultures, aren’t things they can answer during a presidential debate without putting their feet in their mouths. Both Clinton and Sanders, to their credit, responded to Lemon’s questions with better answers than the questions deserved. The answers they gave were reminders of the entire premise of the argument between the two candidates, which CNN and Lemon totally missed: the real problem with racism in America is not the particular feelings in people’s hearts, but the systemic biases and inequalities that put people of color at a disadvantage even when no one is personally being mean to them. Loser: Republican presidential candidates            There were no dick jokes in this debate. It’s an easy shot to take at the Republican field. It’s so easy, in fact, that Clinton made it herself (admittedly, without mentioning the dick jokes): ”compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week.” But look. It’s true. For anyone who watched both this debate and Thursday’s Republican debate, the contrast between the two was remarkable. Clinton and Sanders went after each other on their policies and their records, but managed to avoid ad hominem attacks. To be fair to the Republican field and the Fox News anchors who moderated Thursday’s debate, there were substantive issues discussed there too! It’s just that no one remembers those, because Donald Trump started the debate by talking about his penis, and his subsequent bullying (and Marco Rubio’s weird and pathetic attempts to emulate said bullying) dominated the rest of the debate. It’s not the fault of Ted Cruz or John Kasich that Thursday night’s circus happened. And in fairness, the only people who watched both debates are political insiders anyway. But the juxtaposition of that debate and this one simply looks bad for the Republican Party and its candidates. Bernie Sanders wanted to finish his point and let Hillary Clinton know it    "
2016-03-07,"WASHINGTON (AP)  —   In their haste to show solidarity with people hurt by the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the Democratic presidential contenders understated what officials in Michigan are doing about it. A look at some of the claims in the debate Sunday night, staged in Flint: HILLARY CLINTON: ”The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city.” THE FACTS: It is. So far, Michigan has come forward with $70 million and Gov. Rick Snyder has called for an additional $165 million. ___, BERNIE SANDERS: ”First thing is, you say people are not paying a water bill for poison, and that is retroactive.” THE FACTS: The state Legislature already has authorized $30 million to cover, retroactively, 65 percent of the water portion of people’s water and sewer bills. That covers some, but not all, of what residents owe. ___, CLINTON on the   Partnership trade agreement: ”I thought it was reasonable to know what was in it before I opposed it.” THE FACTS: Not knowing the final details of the trade deal did not stop her from taking a position on it before: She favored it before she opposed it. As Obama’s secretary of state, Clinton was far more enthusiastic about the Pacific trade deal taking shape than she became once she was running for president and trying to appeal to the liberal wing of her party. As secretary she had given speeches around the world in support of the deal under negotiation, saying in Australia in 2012 that it ”sets the gold standard in trade agreements,” a cheerleading sentiment she echoed elsewhere. She’s said the final agreement didn’t address her concerns. But the final version actually had been modified to drop certain provisions that liberal activist groups had opposed. ___, SANDERS: If you are white, ”you don’t know what it’s like to be poor.” THE FACTS: Less likely to know, but there are, of course, millions of poor whites. The Census Bureau’s   American Community Survey, covering 2007 to 2011, found 14. 3 percent of the overall population fell below the poverty level, with American Indians and Alaska natives being the poorest (27 percent of that group) followed by blacks (25. 8 percent). Hispanic poverty rates ranged from 16. 2 percent for Cubans to 26. 3 percent for Dominicans. The white poverty rate was 11. 6 percent, below the national average. ___, Eggert reported from Flint, Michigan. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

2016-03-08,"       Hillary Clinton never looked comfortable at Monday’s town hall event in Detroit, her first appearance on the Fox News Channel in almost two years. She stood   through much of her   session with moderator Bret Baier, and her exclamation at the end  —   “Oh, my gosh, it went by so fast!”  —   was thoroughly unconvincing. It had clearly been a grind. But the Democratic presidential   and her supporters should be glad she participated for what I assume is the very reason she was reluctant to do so: Fox pressed Clinton on issues that are important to many conservatives and managed to throw her  . That might sound like a bad thing for her, but the results were actually some of her best, most substantive responses of the campaign. Baier challenged Clinton to explain her position on abortion, something no moderator in any of the seven Democratic debates has done.   [Marco Rubio is right: The media should scrutinize Democrats’ abortion stances, too]   Baier: I want to ask you about a question I asked Senator Sanders. Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it’s born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy? Clinton: Well, again, let me put this in context because it’s an important question. Right now, the Supreme Court is considering a decision that would shut down a lot of the options for women in Texas, and there have been other legislatures that have taken similar steps to try to restrict a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. The Supreme Court case, while topical, had little to do with the question. Clinton went on to talk about defending Planned Parenthood  —   another tangent. These were talking points, not answers, so Baier tried again.   [Supreme Court hears arguments on Texas   case]   Baier: Just to be clear, there’s no  —   without any exceptions? Clinton: No. I have been on record in favor of a   regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother. I object to the recent effort in Congress to pass a law saying after 20 weeks, you know, no such exceptions, because although these are rare, Bret, they sometimes arise in the most complex, difficult medical situations. Baier: Fetal malformities and . .. Clinton: . .. And threats to the woman’s health. Baier: Sure. Clinton: And so I think it is  —   under Roe v. Wade  —   it is appropriate to say, in these circumstances, so long as there’s an exception for the life and health of the mother. Now we’re getting somewhere. Clinton didn’t want to mention her support for   abortion restrictions, but Baier forced her hand with his  . And she ought to be happy that he did. When Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) complained in a February debate that Democrats haven’t been pressed on their abortion stances, he also said Clinton ”believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.” That’s not accurate, but Clinton can’t debunk that kind of false attack if she never talks about the abortion restrictions she favors. Later in the town hall, Baier raised the issue of Clinton’s private email use as secretary of state. When he did, Clinton reverted to one of her favorite arguments: ”Nothing I sent was marked classified or that I received was marked classified.” If only it were that simple. Any voter who has followed the story knows that the State Department, as it released Clinton’s emails in batches, redacted more than 2, 000 messages because they contained classified material. Without further explanation, Clinton’s response looks like an outright lie. Baier pushed for a clarification.   [State Department releases final batch of Clinton emails]   Clinton: Well, what I’m saying is, it wasn’t [classified] at the time. Now, if you  —   let’s take Mary Smith who has some information in the government. And she is FOIAed  —   Freedom of Information Act  —   give us your information, your memos, your emails, whatever it might have been. That then goes through a process. So even though the agency she works in has none of this as classified, others start to have a chance to weigh in. So others might say, you know, that wasn’t at the time, but now with circumstances, we don’t want to release it, so, therefore, we have to classify it. It wasn’t a perfectly smooth answer, but it conveyed a point Clinton should make more often: Yes, many of the emails on her private server are now classified, but they were not at the time she sent or received them. Clinton might prefer to say ”nothing was classified” and have the argument end right there. But that’s just not realistic. Forced to provide a more nuanced answer, she might have actually delivered an explanation that will satisfy some Fox News viewers who view her skeptically. Clinton probably didn’t win hordes of conservative converts Monday, but she answered tough questions in a way that might at least make some temper their disdain and that might appeal to independents. That’s worthwhile. That’s why she should do this more often. "
2016-03-09,"A   model raised more than a few eyebrows when she walked the Valentino runway at Paris Fashion Week yesterday with her nipples exposed. The model, who appeared particularly young, took to the catwalk in an extremely sheer dress embellished with sequins, leaving her right breast almost completely uncovered. In France, the Chambre Syndicale, organizers of Paris Fashion Week, have enforced a lower age limit of 16 when it comes to catwalk work. However, the issue of girls modeling at such a young age is controversial  —   and not every country has the same rules. In the US, the state of New York passed a law that classified models under the age of 18 as child performers in an effort to try to curb    being used on the runway. It has been claimed in the past that designers favor younger girls as “young,  ” models look better in their designs. Speaking to the Evening Standard ahead of London Fashion Week, Carole White,   of London’s Premier Model Management, said: “The designers want straight up and down  —   no boobs. ” White previously said the agency often scouted in schools because the “very skinny” girls the fashion houses wanted were normally “really young. ” Style consultant Nick Ede has previously said that nudity is something models should expect, adding: “A model showing off their nipples is something that has never been frowned at in the fashion world. “It’s just something that happens and is not seen in any other way than a piece of flesh being exposed. “A model is always asked if they are comfortable in their clothes and nowadays with selfies, it’s just not something that people have issues with. I don’t think there should be any ruling on the exposure of a nipple. ”"
2016-03-10,"Univision anchor Jorge Ramos grilled Hillary Clinton for a commitment that she would not deport children during Wednesday night’s Democratic presidential debate, asking her to clarify her stance nearly a   times. Ramos started by playing a clip from an earlier interview he had done with Clinton where he asked if she would be the next “  ” as President. He noted that she twice declined to say she would not deport children. “So if you really don’t want to be the next    can you promise tonight that you won’t deport children and that you won’t deport immigrants who don’t have a criminal record and this time, could I get a yes or no answer?” He asked. “Yes, you can, because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum,” Clinton replied. “And we have laws. That was the most critical thing I said. Under our laws. I would like to see those laws changed. ” She also said would prioritize deporting “violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety” and she does not share the same policy views as the Obama administration. “But again, yes or no. Can you promise tonight that you won’t deport children who are already here?” Ramos asked again. “I will not deport children. I would not deport children I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge,” Clinton said. “As I said, I want to prioritize who would be deported. Violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That’s a relatively small universe. ” But Ramos wasn’t satisfied. He responded, “So I want to be very specific. So you’re telling us tonight that if you become President, you won’t deport children who are already here?” “I will not,” Clinton said. “And that you won’t deport immigrants who don’t have a criminal record?” Ramos asked. “That’s what I’m telling you. Now I don’t  —   because I’m not contradicting what I told you in the interview. Asylum is a particular legal process. I’d like to see it changed,” she said. “So you will stop those deportations  —  ” Ramos replied. “I would stop  —  ” Clinton began. “The deportations for children and those who don’t have a criminal record,” he finished. “Of the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That’s is exactly what I will do,” Clinton said."
2016-03-11,"Investors shook off skepticism over the ECB’s stimulus package disclosed on Thursday, which was overshadowed by signals of an end to rate cuts, said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago.  ”It seemed to me this is yesterday’s rally delayed until today,” said Kuby. Investors ”reassessed and realized it was good news.” Friday’s bullish session was also strengthened by steadying oil prices, which have remained closely correlated with equities throughout the year. U. S. crude was up almost 2 percent and Brent was above $40 per barrel after the International Energy Agency said oil prices may have bottomed as output in the United States and other   countries was beginning to fall quickly. The combined oil and natural gas U. S. rig count fell to its lowest on records going back to 1940, according to data from Baker Hughes. The Dow Jones industrial average   rose 218. 18 points, or 1. 28 percent, to 17, 213. 31, the S&P 500   gained 32. 62 points, or 1. 64 percent, to 2, 022. 19 and the Nasdaq Composite   added 86. 31 points, or 1. 85 percent, to 4, 748. 47. For the week, the Dow rose 1. 2 percent, the S&P gained 1. 1 percent and the Nasdaq added 0. 7 percent, marking the fourth consecutive positive week for the three indexes. The cost of protection against a decline in the S&P 500, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index . VIX, hit its lowest this year. The S&P 500 is now down 1. 1 percent for the year, staging a sharp recovery from a selloff at the start of the year that was partly driven by a rout in oil. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Devon Energy ( ) which rose 11. 4 percent, while the largest decliner was Pepco Holdings POM. N, down 9 percent. Investors now turn their attention to the U. S. Federal Reserve, which is set to meet on March   to decide on interest rates. The Fed has said it is on track to raise rates gradually this year, but its decision will hinge on the health of the economy. Recent data has shown the U. S. labor market remains strong but wage growth remains a concern. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a ratio of more than    and on the Nasdaq the ratio was 3.   favoring advancers. The S&P 500 posted 39 new   highs and one new low; the Nasdaq recorded 69 new highs and 59 new lows. About 7. 5 billion shares changed hands in U. S. exchanges, below the 8. 5 billion daily over the last 20 sessions.  (Reporting by Laila Kearney) WASHINGTON   Federal Reserve policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises, according to the minutes of the Fed’s last policy meeting on June   released on Wednesday. Shares of U. S. auto parts retailers fell sharply on Wednesday after O’Reilly Automotive Inc  said its   sales were much below the company’s estimates for the second quarter, due to a mild winter and weak demand.

2016-03-12,"A spokeswoman for Donald Trump says a man tried to breach the security buffer at his event in Ohio, leading U. S. Secret Service agents to briefly rush the stage to surround the Republican presidential candidate. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks says the man ”was removed rapidly and professionally.” Trump was speaking Saturday at a campaign rally in Dayton when he was briefly surrounded by Secret Service agents, who formed a protective barrier around him. The agents left the stage quickly, and Trump was able to finish his speech and did so without apparent incident. It was not immediately clear why the agents rushed onto the stage Saturday morning to surround Trump, who appeared to jolt after hearing something in the audience standing behind his right shoulder. Four Secret Service agents then rushed onto the stage, as the audience chanted ”Trump! Trump! Trump!” The agents quickly cleared. Trump did not explain what had happened, but said: ”Thank you for the warning. I was ready for ’em, but it’s much better if the cops do it, don’t we agree?” Trump was able to finish his speech and did so without apparent incident. The billionaire businessman called off a rally on Friday night in Chicago, after protesters filled the arena where he was scheduled to speak. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

2016-03-13," Greece increased efforts on Saturday to move thousands of migrants near the border with Macedonia to sheltered camps, as the spread of infection became a concern with one person in a sprawling tent city diagnosed with Hepatitis A. Stranded in filthy conditions near the northern border town of Idomeni, at least 12, 000 people, among them thousands of children, were waiting to cross the frontier although Macedonia and other nations along the   Western Balkan route have closed their borders. Scuffles broke out at the camp in recent days as destitute people scrambled for food and firewood, while many have been sleeping in the open, often in the rain amid low temperatures. Greek authorities handed out leaflets in Idomeni on Saturday informing people that the main route to northern Europe was shut. The pamphlets urged them to move to buildings and hospitality centers across Greece that have been set aside for the purpose, according to a government official from the country’s refugee crisis management coordination body. ”Our aim is not only to relieve Idomeni from the people, our aim is that no Idomeni (camp) even exists anymore. There are structures, why should people stay in the mud?” he said. Leaflets would also be distributed in ports and on islands to discourage people from going to Idomeni, the government official said. ”Greece will offer you accommodation, food and healthcare,” read the leaflets which were written in Arabic, Farsi and Pashtun. Deputy Defence Minister Dimitris Vitsas, in charge of coordinating Greek efforts to tackle the refugee crisis, said 400 people were moved from Idomeni to camps on Friday and the numbers would increase in the coming days.  ”Many of them are waiting for a decision by the (EU) summit on March 17. We are saying that regardless of this decision, there are three camps very close (to shelter them),” he told Greek Mega television.  EU leaders and Turkey are due to meet again on Thursday and Friday to seal a deal to try to stem illegal migrant flows from Turkey to Europe through Greece.  The squalid, overcrowded conditions of the camp in Idomeni have given rise to infection. A   old Syrian girl was diagnosed with Hepatitis A on Friday, according to Greece’s disease control agency. According to the World Health Organisation, Hepatitis A is a virus which is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water, or through direct contact with an infectious person. It is normally associated with a lack of safe water or poor sanitation. ”Conditions at Idomeni are indescribable . .. it’s a swampland created by the rain,” the head of Greece’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) Thanasis Giannopoulos, said on Sunday.  The girl being treated was in a stable condition, Giannopoulos said, adding that the center had already taken action to prevent the disease spreading among migrants in Idomeni. Some 300 to 400 people would be vaccinated against the disease in an initial phase, he said. To ensure water quality, seven water transportation vehicles, three deployed by the Greek army, started operating in Idomeni, the government said in an announcement late on Saturday.

2016-03-14,"The craft, part of the ExoMars program, blasted off from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan on board a Proton rocket, starting a   journey through space. It carries an atmospheric probe that is to study trace gases such as methane    a chemical that on Earth is strongly tied to life    that previous Mars missions have detected in the planet’s atmosphere.  ”Why are we so interested in Mars? We are trying to understand how life originated in our solar system,” Pascale Ehrenfreund, chair of German space agency DLR’s executive board, said at a launch event held by the European Space Agency. Scientists believe the methane could stem from   called methanogenes, that either became extinct millions of years ago and left gas frozen below the planet’s surface, or that some   organisms still survive. Another explanation for the methane in Mars’s atmosphere could be that it is produced by geological phenomena, such as  the oxidation of iron. The spacecraft will deploy a lander that will test technologies needed for a rover due to follow in 2018, one step in overcoming the practical and technological challenges facing possible future human flights to Mars. ”I’m sure in 20 years or 30 years the moment will come when humans will go to the planet,” Thomas Reiter, director of Human Spaceflight and Robotic Exploration at the European agency, said. EARLY LIFE? The second part of the ExoMars mission in 2018 will deliver a European rover to the surface of Mars. It will be the first with the ability to both move across the planet’s surface and drill into the ground to collect and analyze samples. ”If there was early life it could have found refuge in the   and the methane could be connected to that,” ExoMars project scientist Jorge Vago said. Landing on Mars is a notoriously difficult task that has bedeviled nearly all of Russia’s previous efforts and has given U. S. agency NASA trouble as well. The United States currently has two operational rovers on Mars, Curiosity and Opportunity. The cost of the ExoMars mission to the European Space Agency, including the second part due in 2018, is expected to be about 1. 3 billion euros ($1. 4 billion). Russia’s contribution comes on top of that.

2016-03-15,"MSNBC host Chris Matthews promoted the latest “Star Wars” film on his   show after the movie’s director and his spouse  . But the   host of “Hardball,” who took a pledge of transparency when his wife became a candidate last year, never disclosed the $2, 000 in donations from J. J. Abrams and Katie McGrath. The couple live in California  —   a world away from   for an open congressional seat in Maryland. Federal Election Records show that Abrams and McGrath each donated $1, 000 on Oct 20, 2015. Two months later, Matthews began plugging “Star Wars. ” On Dec. 21, he launched his opening monologue by saying, “I’m Chris Matthews in Washington, obviously, coming off what you might call or must call a Star Wars’ weekend. ” Then he mentioned Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton while a photo of the two appeared on screen under a “Star Wars” sign,   which broke the story. A couple of days later, Matthews again gave a shout out to the film, blabbing that he was going to have “a little fun now. ” Moments later, he followed up with, “And I’m not talking about the long line at Star Wars. ” After a commercial break, Matthews starting raving again about the movie, stating, “When it comes to Hollywood hits this year, Star Wars is the king of the galaxy. The latest episode in the space epic broke records last weekend. ” And if that bit of sucking up wasn’t enough, Matthews finally added, “And in just days, it’s earned $700 million worldwide. Movies make  —   $700 million is just beyond anything. ” Last week, it was reported that many current and former political heavyweights featured on his program were donors to his wife’s campaign, a heated contest with nine candidates vying to replace Rep. Chris Van Hollen. A former news anchor and Marriott exec, Kathleen Matthews has received a total of $79, 050 in campaign contributions from prominent former and current politicians featured on the show. “While most of you know that our show doesn’t typically cover congressional races, I will continue to fully disclose my relationship with her as part of MSNBC’s commitment to being transparent and fair in our coverage,” Matthews told his viewers last year. There was no immediate comment from MSNBC or either Chris or Kathleen Matthews."
2016-03-16,"In early September 2014, Apple was preparing to announce a massive iPhone upgrade: bigger iPhones than anything it launched before. But just a few days ahead of the iPhone 6 press event, an iCloud security scandal broke out. Nude pictures   leaked online, originating from iPhone backups. Apple explained at the time that its iCloud security was not breached and that hackers probably employed phishing schemes to obtain the usernames and passwords from their victims. Now, 18 months after the scandal, we finally find out what happened. And it turns out that phishing attacks were indeed used to target the celebrities.       Ryan Collins is the person responsible for phishing login credentials from many celebrities. With usernames and passwords in hand, he was able to log into Gmail accounts and even download iCloud backups from which he extracted nude photos. What Collins did to gain access to at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts between November 2012 and September 2014 was rather simple. He sent his victims emails that looked like they originated from Apple or Google, fooling them into handing over their credentials. Collins was charged in Los Angeles with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He agreed to plead guilty to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information. The prosecutors recommend a sentence of 18 months, the U. S. Attorney’s Office said, rather than the maximum of five years in prison for the offence. There’s no evidence that Collins posted the nude photos online, or that he leaked them, though the investigation continues. “By illegally accessing intimate details of his victims’ personal lives, Mr. Collins violated their privacy and left many to contend with lasting emotional distress, embarrassment and feelings of insecurity,” said the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, David Bowdich. “We continue to see both celebrities and victims from all walks of life suffer the consequences of this crime and strongly encourage users of   devices to strengthen passwords and to be skeptical when replying to emails asking for personal information. ”  "
2016-03-17,"  p. series b. series img. series   About this series: What’s happening in America? What does it mean to be an American? These are questions defining a campaign unlike any other. For nearly 35 days, we crossed the nation looking for answers. This is what we found. PART 1 | PART 2 | PART 3 | PART 4        When Mary Beth Walz picked up a shovel and started to clear the pathway in front of the home of    Doris Eriksson  —   that was a moment when much of the campaign rhetoric this election year seemed hollow. This small gesture occurred in the town of Bow, south of Concord, a few days before the New Hampshire primary. Walz was canvassing for Hillary Clinton in a heavy snowstorm, the footing uncertain enough that later she would slip and lose her car keys in the snow, but it was obvious that there was zero correlation between the votes she was trying to get and the walk she would work to clear. It was just what she did. Some of it may have had to do with the quaint values of a small New England town, but there was more to it than that. Walz and her husband, Harry Judd, both lawyers in their 60s, had been invested in the   of the people of Bow for more than a  . They were not angry. They were not trying to make America great again. They had strong convictions and were what you might c all political animals, but they were not interested in living a life of  .  in a divided country. To classify them as establishment or   was beside the point. They were doing what they could, pragmatically, dutifully, their quotidian efforts overshadowed but not overtaken by the grandiosity of the national political story.  Walz previously had served as a state representative, a job that paid a whopping hundred bucks a year and meant she was dealing with 399 other people holding the same title, the largest state legislative body in the country. Her husband spent a few nights each week on the Bow Planning Board and other volunteer town committees, and on Friday mornings he helped prepare food and coffee for the Rotary breakfast meetings at the Old Town Hall. They both worked as election officials whenever there was a vote to be held, and seemed to know everyone in town, from the young woman who serves as police chief to the big ol’ guy in the hunting outfit who was the leader of the local National Rifle Association chapter.    Former New Hampshire state representative Mary Beth Walz shovels snow for Doris Eriksson, 92, while canvassing for Hillary Clinton in Bow on Feb. 5. (Linda   Washington Post)  When Walz left the state legislature a few years ago, she thought it was a different place than it once had been. She prided herself on working with Republicans to get things done. One of her favorite people at the statehouse had been the House clerk, Karen Wadsworth, an   New England Republican who before taking the clerk’s job had served as mayor of Lebanon and as a state representative for 10 years. That morning, Wadsworth was at the Rotary in Bow, sitting near Judd, Walz’s husband. She said she felt like an endangered species as a Republican Christian who was “neither extreme nor born again” and who believed in getting along with people regardless of political affiliation. There had been much talk this year among Republicans about a longing for something that seemed to have been lost in American culture, but what did that mean? To some, like Donald Trump, it sounded as simple as winning vs. losing. Some would say it was a sense of American strength in the world. Or a dilution of national identity because of immigration or multiculturalism or political correctness. To Wadsworth, it was something else. “I keep coming back to the word ‘respect.’ Respect for others, for other ideas. ” She thought that social media, while allowing people to communicate more freely and widely, also had made the public conversation nastier. “You keep seeing things that are personal rather than discussing the issues,” she said. Were individual people angrier than they used to be, and more negative, or did technology and culture combine to make it easier for them to project the angriest and least tolerant sides of themselves? Wadsworth said that she did not have caller ID, so she always picked up her telephone when it rang and was distraught by the nature of the incessant campaign calls. “It’s all, which issue frightens you the most? Nobody says what’s going on that’s hopeful, but what do you fear? I usually say none of the above. ” A variation of that conversation was playing out at the University of New Hampshire over in Durham, where Joe Sweeney, a young Republican in the most literal sense, at age 22 a member of the state legislature, had gone to watch a Democratic debate. The scene was the Phi Mu Delta fraternity house, a dingy hangout, up a creaky set of stairs, with eight boxes of pizza, plastic boxes of   cookies, stools circled around a   TV that was balanced on two dinged pieces of furniture pushed together.    New Hampshire state Rep. Joe Sweeney and his friend Sarah Vallon watch a Democratic debate on television at his Phi Mu Delta fraternity house in Durham on Feb. 4. Sweeney, 22, a Republican, is studying political science at the University of New Hampshire. (Linda   Washington Post)  The debate itself between Clinton and Bernie Sanders was being held minutes away on campus, and somehow the notion of watching politicians discuss debt and health care had transfigured itself into   entertainment. Rep. Sweeney, with his pinchable cheeks and plaid shirt, was already in his second term and thinking of running for a third. He had a sense of politics beyond his years, going back to the days when he was an adolescent and watched his mom speak out against floodlights being added to a baseball field. Even he longed for the good old days that he never really experienced, before congressional gridlock, before Republicans and Democrats at the statehouse seemed so determined not to associate with each other. He found politics equally fascinating and frustrating, a sensibility he shared with his friend Sarra Vallon, who was there watching the debate with Sweeney and his fraternity brothers. The notion of people building taller silos, avoiding the other side, was something they could not and would not do at the university. They were Republicans on what they considered a lefty college campus and were used to no one agreeing with them. “Every day I try to have a conversation with someone I disagree with,” Sweeney said. “It’s made me a better person. ” “  happened when we were in second grade, and back then, it was all ‘God Bless America,’ ” Vallon said. “And then, at some point, people started getting angry. ” They took time from studying to meet candidates and tried to balance stories they found on Fox News Channel with similar stories from the BBC. They liked watching Democrats, even though they agreed with little they said. And they wondered what kind of world, what kind of voter would ever support a man like Donald Trump. “We were just talking about what we’d do if he won,” said Vallon, who considered maybe sitting out the general election. “I just don’t get it. It doesn’t make sense. I guess people are really angry and just uninformed. ” A lanky fraternity brother with shaggy hair and glasses walked into the living room. “Is Bernie on yet?” he said.  This was Jon Brown, 19, a   student who had started volunteering for Sanders. Before the campaign, he said, all he knew about the senator from Vermont was that “he was an independent socialist who used to come on ‘Stephen Colbert.’ ” But now, as Brown faced tens of thousands of dollars of debt while pursuing his degree, he had become an unabashed supporter. He said he understood why people were so angry about the government. He was among them. “If you look at Republicans or Democrats, you are looking at 10 years of things people don’t trust,” Brown said. “Before, we could trust our government, but then we had the NSA wiretapping, and while the world is getting bigger, our politics are getting so much smaller and more corrupt. ”     People wait in line to hear Bernie Sanders speak at the Politics and Eggs breakfast in Manchester, N. H. on Feb. 5, ahead of the state’s Feb. 9 presidential primary. (Charles   Washington Post)  The debate was about to begin. Cookies were being eaten. A Blue Moon was opened. The crowd was all white, but a mix of genders. The only thing everyone could agree on was that Clinton was untrustworthy and  . Aside from Sweeney and Vallon, most were supporting Sanders, except for one young man who said he was voting for Carly Fiorina, prompting a mocking retort from Sweeney. “You say you are supporting Fiorina, but you are wearing Marco Rubio shoes!” he teased, noticing the prominent heels. The debate started. “Ooh, drama,” Vallon said. “Did she just give Bernie Sanders some shade?” said another. “I just think Hillary Clinton says everything Bernie says after he says it,” Brown said. “She just wants to win. ” “Wasn’t Hillary, like, a massive failure in the ’90s?” said one fraternity brother. “Did Hillary just claim she’s not a part of the establishment?” Sweeney said. “How can that be? Her last name is Clinton!” On a commercial break, Sweeney began to pry. “I can understand not liking Hillary,” he said. “But why do you support Bernie? His plans are going to cost a lot of money. ” “The big issue for me is money in the political system,” Brown said. “If you raise the corporate tax rate, all the companies will just go overseas and we can’t bring jobs back to America,” Sweeney said. “I just can’t see Bernie Sanders talking to Vladimir Putin,” Vallon added.  They stopped as the debate continued. It became progressively less interesting. “I need to study. ” “Thank God! It’s over. ” By the time the final question was asked, only Brown and Sweeney remained in the room. They could not tell who won, or even whether it mattered. “Everyone’s giving up because people are unwilling to compromise, and you look at Congress and it sucks,” Brown said. “We get angry at politicians and we all feel like we have to choose sides. ” “But we can have these sorts of disagreements because we were brothers first and it became easier to respect conversations with each other,” Sweeney said. “I don’t think Americans know each other well. And that’s a part of the problem. ” In a sense, the thing about America, in Sweeney’s estimation, was that it was really one big fraternity. “The coolest thing about being American is it’s not a nationality or a genetic thing, it’s more of an idea,” he said. “It’s a struggle of finding the balance between the collective and the individual, and that’s what makes it hard. ” “We’ll get it one day,” Brown said.  * * *    A protester is escorted out as Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at Plymouth State University in Holderness, N. H. on Feb. 7. (Jabin   Washington Post)   Another night, back in Bow. Counting the Danish visitors in Richard Swett’s living room. They’d all come to look for America. Or at least the New Hampshire version of it, which was unrepresentative demographically, just as Iowa was before it, yet so condensed and local and hyperactive in its presidential primary that it served as a valuable   democratic laboratory. That is why the Danes had descended on the state in full force, a few dozen consultants and journalists and officials fascinated by the American idea. That and the fact that Swett, a former Democratic congressman, had been the U. S. ambassador in Copenhagen during the final two years of Bill Clinton’s administration. How odd it was for them to discover that Denmark could play a role in the American conversation. A few days earlier, they had attended a rally for Jeb Bush, and were listening to the   act from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina, when suddenly their little European nation was Target No. 1. The   plans of Demo cratic candidates, especially Sanders, Graham said with alarm, sounded like “Denmark on steroids. ” And now the Danes had gathered at Swett’s house, where they sat on white folding chairs and commodious couches to watch a Republican debate on television, and right out of the box came a question quoting someone as saying that Donald Trump was so   that the first thing he would do as president is “nuke Denmark. ” Nervous laughter all around. But still. The Danes came with questions that night. They wanted to know whether the excitement about Sanders could be transferred to Clinton if she finally won. They were puzzled by the mystique of Trump, and wondered whether it intersected with the Sanders movement in any strange way. There was another question: Could Europe’s debate about what it meant to be a European illuminate the struggle over competing ideas of what it meant to be an American?  Despite all the agitation in the United States about immigration, and the talk of a weak America that had lost its way, the consensus among the Danes was that the issues in this country seemed more rhetorical than real, especially compared with what they were facing across the Atlantic. They sounded more confident about America than many Americans. The United States, they said, could absorb everything, and that is what made it special. “The financial crisis, the refugee crisis, it is all much more dramatic in Europe,” said Lars L. Nielsen,  the public affairs director for a communications company in Denmark. “There are some echoes in the U. S. debate, but they are contorted, distorted here. ” The question in Denmark, he said, and in most countries in Europe, was not so much what it meant to be a European but what it meant to keep a national identity, “what it meant to be French, or German, or Hungarian, or Danish. ”  The group vs. the individual, the whole vs. the parts. The balance of this tension had been at the core of the American idea from the beginning, eventually creating a mosaic of nationalities and races that had coexisted and melded into a vibrant nation. Europe was struggling with that concept now in a new way, but so, too, once more, was the United States  —   the divides seeming wider and the fractures more painful.   * * *    From left, Steven Siegel, 26, Paul Garver, 75, and Ben Kreider, 32, prepare to canvass for Bernie Sanders in Portsmouth, N. H. on Feb. 6. The trio drove up from Massachusetts to volunteer. (Linda   Washington Post)   Paul Garver woke up that very morning thinking that maybe at last the revolution was upon us. He was 75, a retired union organizer with a white goatee and a cheery disposition. He had watched people from his generation grow disheartened by modern politics, and felt that way himself until Sanders came along. Now here he was, driving up from the Boston suburbs to volunteer in Portsmouth on the New Hampshire seacoast for his fellow democratic socialist, energized not only by conviction but by a sense of possibilities. “He could be the next president,” Garver said. “I always felt that it would take a mix of old leftists and a new generation to bring about the change we always talked about. I’m just glad I can get to see it before I’m gone. ” On the way north, Garver picked up two graduate students at Brandeis. One was Ben Kreider, a    with a   goatee, who knew Garver from the labor movement. And Kreider brought along Steven Siegel, a bespectacled    working on an MBA in nonprofit management. Over his red hair, Siegel wore a blue skullcap with a bow on it  —   a nod to the rest of the world that he existed outside the gender binary. Siegel, who has no preferred gender pronoun, had never canvassed for a presidential candidate before. In Sanders, he saw a bit of himself  —   a Jewish democratic socialist who wanted to go into politics. For these leftists, the past eight years had fostered seasons of love and lament. They had become angry at Republicans who tried to block President Obama’s initiatives and mad at the president himself for disassembling his community organizing arm, “Obama for America,” even as so much of his agenda languished amid partisan gridlock. Obama was not the fundamental disruption they had wished for  —   and it left them wanting more.  “I knew when Obama appointed Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff that he would not be the president we were hoping for,” Garver said. “He was an outsider and he chose a Washington insider to protect him. The problem with Obama was he did not have a fundamental critique of power. He played along with the system too much. ” Said Kreider: “Bernie’s ideologically pure. People know Republicans have been bought by special interests, and there’s a feeling that Hillary might be bought, too. But Bernie is definitely not bought. ”    Voters cheer Sanders at the 2016   100 Club Celebration, a Democratic gathering in Manchester, N. H. on Feb. 5. (Melina   Washington Post)  As they drove up   Siegel questioned what to do if Clinton  —   whom he thought of as careerist,    Hillary  —   ended up defeating his candidate. “Then you do what I’ve been doing for years,” Garver said. “You hold your nose and just vote for the best Democrat. ” “But to me,” Siegel said, “voting for someone as the lesser of two evils feels bad. ” The conversation took an awkward pause. A Clinton presidency was not an America he wanted to imagine. The America that Garver’s passengers grew up believing in just wasn’t working for them. Kreider had degrees from Bowdoin and Georgetown but said he could find a job only at a think tank that paid $15 an hour in the months after he received his master’s degree. He now had $35, 000 in   debt. The dream of two kids and a picket fence seemed like either the implausible vestige of another time or the realities of those who found themselves in the wealthy 1 percent. Owning a home like the one he grew up in seemed out of the question. He wondered whether he would ever be able to afford to raise a family with the advantages he had enjoyed. “I did everything right and I’ve still had to struggle, so I don’t think America is really working for me,” Kreider said. “And if it’s not working for me, then it’s got to be extremely hard for someone who did not have that privilege  —   that privilege of growing up white and male in a   suburb. ” Siegel’s dream was to start a nonprofit organization that used video games to teach science and technology, as well as life skills, to underprivileged teenagers. He had no generational wealth to fall back on  —   his mother died when he was 13, and his father was in an   facility. He never wanted to make a lot of money. “I’ve taken advantage of every opportunity that I could as being a perceived man and white, and still I feel straddled,” Siegel said. “Your generation’s debt is our generation’s draft,” Garver told them. It spurred   whites to reconsider their stations in life and ally themselves with those who had less, he said, when they realized the fundamentals of the country were misguided.    Sanders supporters leave a rally at the Exeter town hall, where their candidate spoke, on Feb. 5 in Exeter, N. H. (Charles   Washington Post)  Garver grew up Republican. A key moment in his political evolution came when, as a graduate student at Harvard, he was dispatched to teach classes at Southern University, a historically black college in Baton Rouge. He saw black students pushed through the education system so superficially that they came to college illiterate. They slept in   dorm rooms and ate spoiled food in dining halls. When they wanted to rebel, he taught them “The Autobiography of Malcolm X” and Paul Goodman’s “Growing Up Absurd”  —   a 1960 tome that discussed angry youth and the corporate system that held them back. His experience at Southern helped mold him as he joined the labor movement and began to push for progressive politicians to run for president: McCarthy, McGovern, Jackson. All lost. And many of the lefties of his generation lost hope. There were times when Garver thought that maybe he should give up, too: During Ronald Reagan’s   in the ’80s, which began to strip away the most powerful and accepted collective groups in the nation, and during George W. Bush’s push for the Iraq War. The rise of Obama gave him hope that young people would be able to carry on the work. The young people are sometimes dismissive of him, he acknowledged, treating him as an    rambling old man. During the car ride, Kreider and Siegel humored his annoyance at the GPS  —   “I don’t like, what’s it called, Siki? She’s always yelling at me”  —   and his reluctance to make   (“Just do it, Paul!” Kreider chided). When they reached Portsmouth, they were assigned to knock on the doors of voters who were leaning toward Sanders. They drove into a wealthy suburb with large garages and sprawling treehouses. Garver stayed with Siegel to watch him canvass for the first time.  First door. A woman answered. Siegel had said he wouldn’t need to follow the script, but now he froze. “Don’t worry, I’m with you,” the woman said. “Hillary is untrustworthy. Bernie’s my guy. ” Then came a man who didn’t want to be bothered and said he hated both Democratic candidates. Then another who appeared at the side door to say that he wouldn’t be voting because the system was too corrupt. “I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t believe in the candidate,” Siegel told him. “I would suggest you Google him. ” “How do I know how much of it is true and how much of it isn’t?” he said. Siegel clomped through an   pool of snow on the front porch of the last house to get to the door. A lanky man with brown hair answered it. “Don’t worry about a thing,” the man said. “If there’s a blizzard, I’m going to walk over there. I never thought I’d live to see the day when a democratic socialist could win! Good job, comrade!”  * * *    John Kasich addresses potential voters at a town hall appearance in Nashua, N. H. on Feb. 7. (Linda   Washington Post)   Among all the candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich stood out. His campaign was in effect a way of looking at things from the perspective of the people out there, not from above. It was a strategy, to be sure, the most effective way for Kasich to operate without the media attention of the others, but it was the reality nonetheless. He was not surrounded by a protective cordon of aides and security agents the way Sanders and Clinton were. He did not hold rallies in cavernous arenas and talk without listening, as Trump did. On this day, he was cracking the hundred mark in terms of town hall meetings in New Hampshire. As the vote neared, these events seemed more like group therapy sessions  —   shelters from the storm. The     governor as the Oprah Winfrey of this disorienting political moment, trying to make people who were anxious, confused and even angry feel a bit better. “We have to slow down,” he said at a town hall meeting in Nashua. “We have to slow down our lives. There are people with no one to share their victories with; no one to share their tears. There are people who are lonely. Can we slow down and listen to our neighbors? Can we listen to our friends?” The questions were not staged. The first one came from a liberal woman who asked him about reproductive rights and why he would not fund Planned Parenthood in Ohio. Kasich’s answer did not satisfy her, nor did it demonize her. “I have never been an enemy of people who don’t think like I do,” he said. At every stop, someone thanked Kasich for running a positive campaign. Some people left dissatisfied, unmoved by his soothing approach. Jim Miller, a retired accountant, walked out of the Nashua session with a stern look. He didn’t like it when Kasich said he would not try to deport 12 million illegal immigrants. “The people who should be getting citizenship are the people who understand the traditions of America,” he said. In his retirement, he sometimes volunteers to help people with their taxes, and some of them don’t know how to speak English. “They want to have Mexico here. ” And at every stop, someone also proved Kasich’s point about loneliness and the desire to connect. These are competing human impulses  —   to disconnect and differentiate from the other, and to connect and feel the commonality of humans. They coexist in most people, and in the body politic this year more than ever. A week and a half later, a video of Kasich hugging a young man would go viral and be seen by millions. He did that every day in New Hampshire. On this day, he encountered Lydia Johnson, an    woman who had Alzheimer’s and neurological problems and came hobbling up in her walker to meet him after all the questions were done. She said she once lived in western Pennsylvania, near where Kasich grew up. She thought she was more of a Sanders person, until she saw Kasich on television and decided she had to meet him. The governor leaned over and smothered her in a warm embrace for more than a minute. There was a bit of deja vu to what Kasich was doing and saying. It was reminiscent of another governor, or in this case a former governor, who moved through New Hampshire trying to feel people’s pain. Bill Clinton in 1992. And now the former president was back, a silhouette of his former self, at the side of his wife. Here he was at a rally in Manchester the next day. The rally itself seemed like a therapy session at first, with the crowd chanting “I believe that we will win! I believe that she will win!” as though saying it enough times might make it so.  Bill Clinton was approaching 70 now, and was a vegan, and had endured heart surgery, and looked more brittle and slower than he used to, both in his mannerisms and in his analysis. He had lived the life of a survivor, his career alternately riding along waves of hope and against currents of dispute. So much of the chaos and anger and disruption of this year had been building for the   since he staked his ambitions in a New Hampshire comeback. And now, campaigning for his wife, he said one thing that lingered as he sought to explain some of the discontent washing over the country. It was a William Butler Yeats quote from “Easter 1916”: Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart.   . navbox . navbox p . navbox b . navbox img . normal    Part 3: What America’s most hyperbolic city can teach us about this campaign.

2016-03-18,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.  —   A jury  delivered a   Friday evening  —   awarding the wrestling legend $115 million for the sex tape the Web site posted in 2012.  Hogan, who stands to win even more money when punitive damages are decided next week, sobbed after the six jurors  returned their verdict. It took them close to six hours to decide that Gawker violated Hogan’s privacy and caused him severe emotional distress by publishing a   with the wife of his former best buddy, Bubba The Love Sponge Clem.  In siding with Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, the jury  decided that he was performing a private act in the sex tape  —   and posting the video wasn’t protected by the First Amendment.  The jury didn’t stop with the media company. It also found Gawker founder Nick Denton and the   who posted the video, A. J. Daulerio, personally liable. Jurors awarded Hogan $55 million in economic damages and another $60 million for emotional distress.  Under Florida state law, Gawker must post a $50 million bond about one month after jurors decide on punitive damages  —   which could have disastrous consequences for the company.  Hogan, who originally sued for $100 million, didn’t comment as he walked out of court, but was emotional after the verdict was read, hugging his lawyers and slapping their backs. “Thank you God for justice, only love 4Life,”  .  he added, “Told ya I was gonna slam another giant. ” Hogan’s lawyers said they were “exceptionally happy. ” “We think it represents a statement as to the public’s disgust with the invasion of privacy disguised as journalism,” the lawyers said in a statement. “The verdict says no more. ”  Denton immediately vowed to appeal. “Given key evidence and the most important witness were both improperly withheld from this jury, we all knew the appeals court will need to resolve the case,” he told reporters, as Dau lerio stood behind him with tears in his eyes. “I want to thank our lawyers for their outstanding work and am confident that we would have prevailed at trial if we had been allowed to present the full case to the jury. That’s why we feel very positive about the appeal that we have already begun preparing, as we expect to win this case. ” Hogan’s lawsuit claimed Gawker  violated his right to privacy by posting the sex tape, which the wrestler said was filmed without his knowledge.  Gawker has maintained that because he’s a public figure, Hogan’s sex life was a matter of public interest and posting the tape was protected by the Constitution. Throughout the   trial, jurors heard from more than a dozen witnesses, including Denton and Daulerio. Hogan also took the stand, saying he was “completely humiliated” when he learned Gawker had posted the video.  The testimony was sometimes   with  Hogan at one point having to admit, “No, seriously, I do not have a   penis,” when asked about a 2006 radio interview with Clem. His     Heather Cole, testifying in a taped  deposition played for jurors,  recounted how her   demanded that she hook up with his pal multiple times. As the jury deliberated,  Hogan tweeted “Praying” to his 1. 42 million followers. During closing arguments, Hogan’s lawyers had insisted Gawker behaved “recklessly” when it published a portion of the sex tape without bothering to ask the wrestling superstar for comment. “What’s significant in the world of Gawker is a tape of my client in a private bedroom with a friend at the lowest point in his life,” said Hogan’s lawyer, Kenneth Turkel. Referring to internal staffer messages, Turkel said Daulerio and his colleagues spent at least a couple of days callously joking about the sex tape. “Mr. Daulerio sits down at the computer with his friends, joking, laughing, mocking, recklessly consuming this content, and with a click uploads this thing up on the Internet and turns this man’s life upside down,” he said. Turkel argued that Gawker saw an impressive spike in unique page views after posting the video  —   and its monetary value, not newsworthiness, was the site’s ultimate concern. “This case defines reckless disregard,” he said. “Every witness was asked, ‘If you knew it would cause him severe emotional distress, would you have done it anyway?’ And every witness said, ‘Yes.’ ” Gawker lawyer Michael Sullivan had argued the posting was “lawful and legal. ”  He urged jurors to protect the First Amendment. “[Hogan] has a very different baseline for privacy,” he said.

2016-03-19,"About an eon ago, David Brooks coined the memorable phrase “  disequilibrium. ” It diagnosed modern elites, politicians in particular, whose jobs endowed them with power that dwarfed the attendant financial compensation. It would seem quaint to fret over SID today, grubby pols having turned the monetizing of “public service” into an art form for which the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is the national museum. Ah, but there’s a new SID in town. Those closely following the GOP presidential sweepstakes have doubtless noticed the haggard Beltway Republicans in its throes:   Disequilibrium. Solace was sought in the triumph of Ohio governor John Kasich, who managed to win his home state primary with less than 50 percent of the vote, denying Trump a sweep of the night’s five contests. The glow was not exactly like “feeling the Bern. ” With this victory, Kasich ran his record to one win and 28 losses (in the Kasich spirit of Christian charity, I’m just counting states and ignoring losses piled up in D. C. Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and so on). As competitors go, Kasich is the ’62 Mets. Yet, Ohio became a ray of establishment hope: an aberrational win by a candidate already mathematically eliminated from contention somehow means the home team still has a shot. RELATED: There Are No Silver Linings for the GOP This Year, To pull this off, it would be necessary  —   though by no means sufficient  —   for vanquished   like Kasich to grab and hold the few delegates they can, keeping Trump under the magic number. Success would mean party leaders keep control of what they see as theirs. They know rigging the convention is a   idea  —   though not so   in this cataclysm of an election cycle that they will dismiss it out of hand. RELATED: Note to GOP Elites Upset about Trump: Wonkery ≠ Leadership, Indeed, it may not even be the most outlandish flyer out there. A #NeverTrump contingent  —   Republicans resolved never to vote for the Donald, no matter how objectionable the opponent  —   met this week to bat around the possibility of launching a   run. The group is   led by very solid conservatives with strong establishment ties. But like the “rig the convention” fantasists, they might as well cut out the   and name Hillary Clinton as their alternative candidate. If Trump wins the GOP nomination, he will already have beaten very strong conservatives in an electorate more   than the one that will vote in November’s general election. While a rigged convention would cause the GOP to be abandoned by Trump supporters, a   gambit would induce many conservatives to flee the party. Either way, the Democrats would win. Were that to happen, the righteously indignant #NeverTrump crowd would pat themselves on the back for sticking to their principles . . .  but would they still feel that way when Elizabeth Warren was sworn in to fill Justice Scalia’s Supreme Court seat  —   while the second President Clinton (assuming she hasn’t been indicted) vets her next two or three Supreme Court nominees during downtime from the Muslim Brotherhood Reset? RELATED:   Forces Frustrated by Congressional GOP’s Silence, The Republican establishment knows all this. So for now, party leaders   these unlikely schemes. Their goal is more modest: to preserve their viability by framing the narrative in which the ongoing 2016 nomination chase is understood. Thus, Tuesday night’s   storyline: The  . Trump’s dominance, the story goes, is an illusion. Yes, he has a lopsided lead, but he has won only about 37 percent of the votes cast. Because of sundry state   rules, this has computed to about 48 percent of the delegate haul, roughly 673. But that still means he’d be losing nearly    among voters, and by a significant number of delegates, if he were running    against The  . Share article on FacebookshareTweet The   is a composite character: sort of like President Obama’s girlfriend in Dreams from My Father, except  . Collectively, The  ’s delegate haul is 738  —   Cruz (411) Kasich (143) and the candidates who’ve suspended their campaigns: Rubio (169) Carson (8) Bush (4) and one each for Fiorina, Huckabee, and Paul. (Chris Christie, Trump’s new man Friday, hatched a   which may seem like nothing but is better than he could do in New Jersey right now.) RELATED: The GOP Should Steal the Nomination from Trump, The Washington wisdom is that we should see the race in terms of Trump versus The  . This means seeing The   as the combined fortress of Republicandom, led by the establishment. Now, about the establishment: Notwithstanding its occasional pretensions to   it is real and identifiable. To be sure, there is validity in the complaint that the term “establishment” is too readily contorted into nonsense, and even slander. Yet it seems silly to suggest that there isn’t an establishment. The Republican party, one of only two major political parties in a country of over 300 million people, started before the Civil War. Any large, hierarchical, diverse, bumptious, and enduring organization could not endure long without leaders, financial backers, and loyalists. The urge to reject a categorical term because it can be demagogued into an epithet is understandable  —   just ask any neoconservative. But you’d still need to call the establishment something, and any substitute term  —   “elites,” “mainstream,” what have you  —   would soon be subject to the same complaint. Which gets us to why “establishment” has become so pejorative. “Trump versus The  ” is the wrong way to analyze the contest. It is actually insurgents versus the establishment, or perhaps   versus Washington. Trump is such a larger than life figure  —   a gauche and buffoonish icon of a society that worships celebrity  —   that it is easy to conflate him with the phenomenon he has tapped into: a seething rage against Washington. Note: I said against Washington, not necessarily against government  —   Trump supporters include many   Democrats and the disaffected white working class (including its   underclass). Those people do not oppose government in principle. They oppose the   Beltway racket: the chummy bipartisan congeries of politicos, strategists,   donors, union bosses,   agitators, lobbyists, and stars of the   political media that is increasingly remote from their strife, that always manages to take care of itself while they struggle. That is the wave Trump is riding, but we shouldn’t confuse the rider with the wave. Ted Cruz, whom I support, has gathered strength by representing   constitutional conservatism, which is similarly hostile to Washington. It accepts the necessity of centralized authority for a few obvious national purposes  —   such as border security, which Washington is indifferent to, and national security, which Washington often uses as a pretext to increase its control. Otherwise, though, it wants the Beltway racket dismantled, the imperious regulatory state rolled back, and the bills paid. Like Trump supporters, Cruz supporters want American sovereignty reinvigorated  —   they are suspicious of   arrangements that straitjacket the U. S. under the guise of “global stability. ” But they want America to lead, guided by its vital interests, on the international stage, not to withdraw from it. They believe free trade is a boon for American consumers, not the scourge of American workers. RELATED: Why There Will Be No Trump Landslide in November, The story of the race is not Trump. The story is the emphatic popular rejection of Republican party leadership. Combined, the   forces have won   of the vote and over   of the delegates  —   a landslide that is even more impressive if you assume (as I do) that much of Marco Rubio’s support came from conservatives who saw him as the candidate most electable in November (i. e. Rubio was not, strictly speaking, the “establishment alternative”). It has become trendy to handicap the race in terms of the “Trump lane” (or “populist lane”) the “conservative lane,” and the “establishment lane. ” That gives the establishment far too much credit. It had no lane it was more like a narrow Beltway bike path, snarling traffic and annoying pedestrians. Sure there was an ocean of money, but there was no popular support. That is why serial contenders fell by the wayside (Walker, Graham, Bush, Christie) just as Kasich will sooner or later. More Donald Trump A Question Needing an AnswerIs Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? You gotta have heart, c. Most remarkable is the SID phenomenon: the higher one’s status in Republican leadership, the less one’s influence over Republican voters, and hence over the GOP nomination battle. SID leads us to a final bit of Washington  : the purportedly pressing matter of “uniting the party. ” The questions are posed: Can Trump change, can he clean up his act in order to entice establishment support? Can Cruz change, can he mend fences with GOP leaders he has antagonized in order to bring them into his fold? Again, that is the wrong way to look at it. What needs changing, desperately, is the Republican party. The establishment needs to make itself acceptable to supporters of these candidates, not the other way around. To my mind, Republican leaders owe it to what they are supposed to stand for to get behind Cruz, not because they need to love him, but because it’s the right thing to do  —   besides being the only way to derail Donald Trump, who would either lose to Hillary or rule like Hillary. One way or the other, though, when the Trump dust finally settles, it will be clear that the Republican party as currently constituted is unsustainable. The people who oppose what the Left is doing to the country want an opposition party. The Republican establishment has shunned that role, preferring to be Washington than to fight Washington. The people are looking elsewhere.  —   Andrew C. McCarthy is as senior policy fellow at the National Review Institute and a contributing editor of National Review. "

2016-03-21,"When a doctor found that Kenicer Carty’s    daughter had a dangerously high level of lead last year, it triggered an alarm of sorts. Officials sent an inspector to Carty’s 1930 row house in northeast Baltimore. It turned out that every single window had hazardous chipping lead paint. The city contracted with the nonprofit Green and Healthy Homes Initiative to replace the windows and inspect her house. They will also fix a leak in a bedroom wall and near the toilet where water pools, because moisture prompts paint to break down. While it’s all welcome help, it has been six months since Carty’s daughter tested positive for lead. She hopes the girl won’t suffer the irreversible behavior or learning problems that lead can cause, but she hasn’t told anyone about the poisoning. ”Because I don’t want people to judge,” she says. ”You know, we live in a society where you’re labeled for just the simplest thing.” Baltimore banned lead paint in 1950, nearly 30 years before the rest of the country.   activism emerged early here, with a volunteer effort among parents in 1986. That became the national Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, which spawned the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative. Baltimore has seen a dramatic decline in cases of lead poisoning, down 86 percent since 2002. But despite these decades of effort, hundreds of Baltimore children are still poisoned every year. Nearly half a million children suffer from lead poisoning nationwide, most of them living in neglected and old houses in   neighborhoods. Testing For Lead In Children, The problem drew national attention last year after the death of Freddie Gray, the young, black Baltimore man fatally injured in police custody. Court documents show that Gray had a devastatingly high   level as a toddler, an amount medical experts say surely would have harmed his ability to focus and learn in school or even hold a steady job. His family later sued a property owner over the poisoning and received an undisclosed settlement. Ruth Ann Norton, a longtime activist who heads Green and Healthy Homes, says it’s taken the country far too long to adapt policy to science, which has shown that any level of lead is harmful to children. ”For decades, we were telling families, kids who had levels of 2, 3, 4, 9, that they were really safe,” she says. ”That was the message, and we knew they weren’t safe.” Maryland’s legal threshold for triggering action on lead poisoning is still 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood. The city of Baltimore has lowered its threshold to 5, in line with a change by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2012. City Health Commissioner Leana Wen says Baltimore also has universal lead testing, but it’s a challenge to carry out. She wants funding for instant testing in doctor’s offices. ”A primary care doctor may recommend that the child is tested,” she says. ”However, by the time that parent goes to a lab and then gets that report back, some kids may fall through the cracks during that time.” Maryland’s governor has announced that the state will also start testing every   and    for lead. Norton says that’s great, but it’s not a solution. ”There’s only one cure for lead poisoning, for the irreversible,   impact of lead poisoning,” she says, ”and that’s prevention.” Getting Rid Of Lead In Houses, Maryland has a housing registry that lets people check for rental units certified as lead safe. It originally covered only houses built before 1950, but recently was expanded to include houses built up until 1978, when the federal government banned lead paint. Tenants can also report problems. ”The good news is that Maryland has been very aggressive,” says Ben Grumbles, Maryland’s secretary of the environment. ”They have the right to notify their landlord under Maryland law if they see chipping, peeling or flaking paint and to get the landlord to fix that.” But extensive reporting by the Baltimore Sun finds landlords don’t always fix the problem. And state auditors say the registry of hundreds of thousands of homes is riddled with errors. Grumbles says the state, along with the EPA, is investigating one private inspector who may have wrongly certified nearly 400 rental units as  . He also says the state has sent out thousands of letters to track down property owners who are not on the registry and is updating its computer technology. But even when the law works, it requires landlords to take action only after testing finds a child with a lead level of 10. Legislation that would have lowered that legal threshold by half recently failed to pass after landlords opposed it. Thomas Tompsett of the Maryland   Association says expanding landlords’ liability would, perversely, lead to less affordable housing. ”Unfortunately the more we are sued and the more risk reductions we have to do, all those costs unfortunately pass on to the tenant, in most cases,” Thompsett says. Beyond state and local failures, activists complain that the federal government has chronically underfunded lead poisoning prevention efforts. ”There should be a program initiated to remove lead from every home in the country,” says attorney Brian Brown, who sues landlords on behalf of   children. ”There’s no doubt in my mind that if rich white kids were the ones being poisoned by lead, this problem would have been solved 75 years ago.” Norton says studies show a   investment would more than pay off, saving money on everything from social services and education to the criminal justice system. ”The kids will read better,” she says. ”They’re going to be less likely to be violent. They will live healthier. Why wouldn’t we do it?” Since the Flint, Mich. water crisis drew national attention, Norton has been pushing the Obama administration to create a national task force to take up that very question."
2016-03-22,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. In 1947, the    dynastic Brooklyn Dodgers moved their spring training camp to Havana, Cuba. As a venue, it made good sense —  Havana offered warm winter weather and stellar baseball facilities. But what made Havana most attractive was its isolation Jackie Robinson, recently promoted from the minors, was just weeks away from breaking American professional baseball’s color barrier, and Branch Rickey, the team’s president and general manager, sought to shield the outfielder from untoward attention as he trained with the team. The scheme actually worked too well. At the time, the talent on display in the Cuban League, racially integrated for decades by then, was such that the presence of American pros did little to inspire crowds to turn up for games. (Poor attendance that spring actually caused one preseason series between the Dodgers and the St. Louis Browns to be canceled.) Last Sunday, nearly 70 springs and an embargo later, when Barack Obama, the No. 42 of American presidential politics, boarded Air Force One for his historic sojourn to Cuba, he did so with two guests of honor —  Rachel and Sharon Robinson, the widow and daughter of Jackie. The symbolism wasn’t subtle: The Robinsons and the Obamas embody the cause and effect of the effacing of   biases. Or, failing all of that, the United States and Cuba share a historic love of baseball. Like most everything, the genesis story of baseball in Cuba is disputed. Writing in The Atlantic in 1984, Bruce Brown tells of the mythical 1866 arrival of an American ship at Matanzas Bay seeking to load up on Cuban sugar and unload American baseball. “Cubans joke that the Americans were motivated at least in part by a desire to sell baseball equipment,” he wrote, “nonetheless, they helped build a baseball diamond at Palmar del Junco, where the first baseball games in Cuban history were played. ” Another recasting of baseball’s origins characterize its debut not as a byproduct of cultural imperialism, but rather in subversive relief to the staid bullfighting rituals of the island’s colonial rulers. For a time under Spanish rule, the sport was actually banned in Cuba. On Tuesday, when President Obama heads to Havana’s Estadio Latinoamericano to watch the Tampa Bay Rays, the Calvin Coolidge of MLB squads, take on the Cuban National Team, it will serve as the grace note to a visit designed to minimize the differences that have long set the two countries at odds. Many of those ideological divisions can be discerned through the lens of their shared pastime. In contrast to the United States, Cuban baseball has long been beset by the issues of gambling and corruption while the scourge of   drugs have remained more of a footnote. The American analogue is marked by high ticket prices and astronomical player contracts while even the best Cuban sluggers make a petty salary and admission to a game costs pennies for fans. In one telling incident, U. S. officials came under scrutiny after initially banning the Cuban team from participating in the 2006 World Baseball Classic held in California. Writing in The New York Times, Roberto González Echevarría, a literature professor at Yale and Sagua La   expert on Cuban baseball, offered this scathing retort: I appreciate the fans’ desire to see some of the finest players in the world, but it hardly stretches the truth to say that those who want Cuba to participate are asking to be entertained by a team of slaves. Consider this: the option not to play in the tournament, which has been exercised by the Yankees’ Hideki Matsui among others, is not available to Cuban players   if the government tells them to play, they must. On the other hand, the regime can suspend a player from ”Team Fidel,” as the national team is often called, simply out of suspicion that he might defect. This happened to Orlando Hernández, before he managed to escape in a boat and eventually find fame with the Yankees. Cuba, long a dominant force in international play, was eventually allowed to participate and won the silver. When the Rays arrived in Havana over the weekend, several baseball emissaries accompanied the team, including MLB commish Rob Manfred and retired Yankees star Derek Jeter. Among the most notable dignities, however, was a player almost no one has ever heard of: Dayron Varona from Tampa’s   affiliate. The   outfielder defected from the island in 2013 to pursue his dreams in the majors. Upon arriving in Havana on Saturday, Varona saw his family for the first time in three years."
2016-03-23,"BOCA RATON, Fla.  —   NFL owners approved The Odell Beckham Rule on Wednesday, even though it wouldn’t have applied to the Giants star at his most controversial moment last season. At least on a trial basis for the 2016 season, players will be ejected for receiving two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the same game after a   from the owners at their annual meeting. The move was made in response to Beckham’s infamous,   war of words and cheap shots with Josh Norman of the Panthers last December at MetLife Stadium. Beckham was suspended one game after getting two unnecessary roughness penalties for sparring with Norman throughout Carolina’s   victory and delivering one particularly vicious cheap shot to Norman’s head, while Norman was fined $26, 044 for his actions. But while   might have been the impetus for the crackdown, Beckham would not have been ejected if the new rule had been in place because coaches lobbied to have the rule narrowly tailored. Ejection will now be mandatory only for multiple fouls that result from throwing a punch or kicking an opponent, using “abusive” language or gestures or using acts considered “baiting or taunting. ” According to league research, just two players  —   Titans defensive end Brian Orakpo and Chargers safety Jahleel Addae  —   would have been ejected for multiple conduct penalties if the rule had been in place in 2015. The rules change was expected once NFL commissioner Roger Goodell came out in favor of it at the Super Bowl. “We’ve had points of emphasis in the past in the competition committee, [but] they need teeth,” Goodell said Wednesday. “This was a rule that brought teeth to that. It brought an opportunity for the rules to reflect the emphasis that   …     sportsmanship is important to us. ” Owners also approved a   trial that will move the spot of the ball after a touchback to the   line, from the 20, in the hope that it will improve safety by cutting down on the number of kick returns. But Falcons president Rich McKay, one of the key members of the league’s competition committee, admitted the change could produce the opposite result if teams decide to kick high and short in hopes of pinning the returner inside the 25. “We passed that for one year because we do want to see if it changes the numbers [of returns] and to see how it impacts the game, because there is that thought that there will be some more short kicks,” McKay said Wednesday. “We’ll see. ” Goodell denied a Wall Street Journal report last week that the NFL is close to a deal with the union that   and give it to a panel of arbitrators. “We have had discussions about discipline process for decades,” he said. “We’re always open to that. If we can find a better discipline system let’s do it. [But] we’re not close to an agreement by any stretch. ” Goodell also denied a claim in that same report that the league is prepared to settle its Deflategate court case with Tom Brady before a federal appeals court renders its verdict, most likely in the next two months. Goodell acknowledged receiving a letter from Patriots owner Robert Kraft requesting that the league return the 2016   pick New England forfeited for Deflategate. To the surprise of no one, Goodell denied the request. “I didn’t think there was any new information in there that would cause us to alter discipline, so there will be no changes to the discipline,” Goodell said. Teams can now designate the one player on injured reserve eligible to return each year the day that player comes back to practice, instead of having to decide at the time of the injury."

2016-03-25,"Presidential candidates are given a lot of running room by voters and most journalists when it comes to policy pronouncements. No one expects them to publish a full budget or lengthy white papers with detailed legislative plans. But even by the loose standards of presidential campaigns, Donald Trump is setting a new low for vacuous rhetoric. Trump’s supporters are drawn to him in part because they think he tells it like it is, unlike other politicians. But on the budget, as with trade and immigration, he is telling voters what they want to hear, even though it is not true, just as most conventional politicians have been doing for decades. Trump’s other statements and positions, however, make it clear that he’s not inclined to implement a genuine conservative budget but is more likely to fall into the kind of procrastination and   that has led to today’s massive deficits and debt. What Trump implicitly promises is a closing of the gap between federal revenue and spending without any pain for ordinary voters. He claims that better management, led by him, is all it will take. It is the worst kind of wishful thinking and deception. It is not possible to address the nation’s fiscal challenges while protecting, now and in the future, entitlement spending  —   unless you are willing to impose massive tax hikes, such as those President Obama proposes. In 1970, combined federal spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid was 3. 7 percent of GDP. Today, spending on these programs, plus the new subsidies for insurance under Obamacare, accounts for more than 10 percent of GDP. And spending on these programs will reach 14. 2 percent of GDP by 2040 unless they are changed to reduce their costs. Share article on FacebookshareTweet President Obama’s answer to the growing problem of entitlement spending is simple: more revenue. Over the past fifty years, federal revenue has averaged 17. 7 percent of GDP. Tax hikes implemented during the Obama years would already push revenue up to 19. 4 percent of GDP by 2040. But the president and his supporters want to raise taxes even more to cover the rising costs of entitlement programs. Trump says he disagrees. He has proposed a tax cut of at least $10 trillion over the coming decade. But he has often said that he has no problem raising taxes on   managers and other    Americans who he believes can and should pay more. Faced with massive deficits, and with a commitment not to touch entitlements, it is a safe bet than a President Trump would find raising taxes to solve the problem a very tempting proposition. And a lot of Democrats in Congress would concur. RELATED: D. C.’s   Establishment Spooked by ‘Bizarro’ Trump Team, Trump is for repealing Obamacare. But repeal of Obamacare would actually increase federal deficits unless the spending cuts in Medicare are left in place. And repeal will not be possible without a credible replacement plan, especially since Trump promises he will “take care of everyone. ” (So far, Trump’s   proposals are little more than meaningless talking points.) A real replacement plan would cost less than Obamacare, but the savings would not be sufficient to close the large deficits projected for the coming years and decades. Trump has also said he will find savings elsewhere in the budget. When pressed to be more specific, his answer is always the same: elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse. This is the most tired, canned answer in the book. Every politician who wants to pretend he’s serious about cutting spending without actually cutting spending resorts to denunciations of unspecified waste in the budget. The only surprise is that Trump hasn’t yet said he will also cut congressional pay and foreign aid. More Donald Trump A Question Needing an AnswerIs Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? You gotta have heart, c. Previously, Trump said he would find $300 billion in annual savings by negotiating down the prices Medicare pays for prescription drugs. This is, itself, problematic, given that such spending only amounts to $80 billion per year. But Trump seems now to have dropped the idea from his   plan, instead proposing to allow the importation of drugs at prices set by nationalized health systems. The latter proposal would probably reduce federal spending, but only by very small amounts. The picture that emerges from Trump’s various statements on budgetary matters is not encouraging. Voters have heard him promise repeatedly that he would cut taxes and make no changes whatsoever to entitlement programs. This is certainly one reason he is popular with some voters. When pressed on how he would reconcile these commitments with large and growing deficits, he promises to target drug companies, rich people, and unspecified wasteful spending. In other words, he gives answers that sound pretty much like what President Obama would say in response to the same questions.  —   James C.

They teeter between hope and despair and can’t grieve or find closure, says Red Cross psychosocial worker   Henry. ”They need answers, but at the moment all they have are questions  —   ’where is my husband, my wife, my sister? ’” Henry is one of the volunteers helping the families at the   military hospital where they wait, many with photos and other mementos they hope will speed up the identification process. Members of the Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) team say they have gone to the hospital once a day to update relatives on their progress. But even with 30 team members working 15 hours a day, it is slow going, says Dr. Jean Crevecoeur, a forensic dentist tasked with identifying the metro bombing victims. He says the DVI team is working over the   Easter holiday weekend in hopes of wrapping up identifications by Sunday. Crevecoeur says the work has been incredibly difficult. The powerful bombs left the team trying to identify many victims through body parts and charred remains, he says. The injured, dead and missing also hail from 40 different countries, which is not surprising given the blasts occurred at an international airport departure hall and beneath the European Union office district, where citizens from 28 countries work. It took until Thursday just to identify all of the injured, Henry says. As for those killed, most were in the subway or hadn’t checked in yet at the airport, which means Belgian authorities have had to wait for relatives to come forward to figure out who was missing. And even when they did, it’s taken days for DVI requests for photos, dental   and other records to be answered, given the need for translators and intervention by foreign embassies. Crevecoeur says Belgian forensic experts prefer using scientific evidence over visual identification to verify identities. Such biometric data includes dental records, fingerprints, DNA and whatever else is necessary to ensure 100 percent match, he says. He says he sympathizes with families and how hard it is for them to wait, but shrugs off questions of what the team could have done differently to speed up identifications. ”It’s not relevant, because we believe accuracy in our findings is more important than being quick,” he explains. Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav, who heads ZAKA, Israel’s main emergency response and recovery organization, rejects that explanation. ”I think it’s absurd, the time it’s taking,” he says. ”It’s not only dishonoring the dead, but dishonoring those who are still alive. Because as long as the [victims] are not brought to rest and buried, families can’t start the psychological process of accepting the loss.” For religious reasons  —   Jewish and Muslim laws mandate speedy burials  —   and given Israel’s vast experience with suicide bombings, Zahav says his recovery teams rely heavily on family and witness help. He says they often identify terror victims in a matter of hours. ”There is a great importance in identifying and determining things at the beginning, because later on it’s difficult to do,” he says. ”And then you have to do CTs, blood tests, MRIs” and   DNA analysis. He adds that autopsies in bombing cases are unnecessary, ”because we know the cause of death.” Zahav says his teams flew to Turkey after the suicide attack in downtown Istanbul last Saturday. ”Within 24 hours, we were able to bring our casualties to burial because the Turks were willing to accept our help,” Zahav says. Three Israelis were killed in that blast. Back in Belgium, Dr. Philippe Boxho, who heads the Forensic Center of Liege, defends his DVI colleagues’ efforts in Brussels. He points out they aren’t exactly novices, having helped identify victims of the tsunami that devastated the Thailand coast in 2004, as well as the Malaysia Airlines jet shot down over Ukraine in July 2014. ”They want to work in optimal conditions,” he says of the reason why bodies in the Brussels blast were moved from the attack sites to a military hospital and university. ”We don’t want the public around, because we have to gather bodies destroyed by the explosion and genetically identify those parts so we can give the remains back to the families.” The lack of information this week drove dozens of relatives and friends to post on social media seeking news of those who were missing. The requests moved web designer David Geilfus, 35, to collect those posts, weed out inaccurate or outdated ones and place them on a page he created on Trello, a platform that’s often used for work projects or wedding planning. He says more than 20 people  —   mostly friends and colleagues of the missing  —   posted queries on the Web page as word of it spread. ”I guess it’s very difficult to identify them,” Geilfus says. But ”having still so many people missing is incredible. I don’t know what to say.” Brussels prosecutor Ine Van Wymersch told the Associated Press Saturday that seven victims of the 31 have yet to be identified, while the Trello page as of Sunday listed 8 as missing."
2016-03-27," Easter season is upon us, and if you’re like a majority of Americans who celebrate the holiday, you’ll probably purchase some candy for the occasion. And that stash will likely include the    hallmark of the season: Peeps.    But just where did these squishy harbingers of spring come from? And why are they so popular? Read on to find out. Mmm,   marshmallows with eyes             In their traditional form, Peeps are shaped like baby chickens and made of a soft marshmallow rolled in colored sugar, with eyes made of edible wax. They are typically sold in packs of five conjoined marshmallows. One serving of Peeps (five pieces) contains 140 calories, no fat, and 34 grams of sugar, which makes sense since their two main ingredients are sugar and corn syrup. Peeps also contain gelatin, which makes them unsuitable for vegans. Peeps are manufactured by the Bethlehem,   Just Born candy company, which was founded in 1910 by a Russian immigrant named Sam Born and also manufactures such    offenses as Mike & Ikes and Hot Tamales.    According to Just Born’s company history, Born is to thank for several confectionary feats we now take for granted, including producing chocolate sprinkles and that type of chocolate sauce that hardens into a crunchy shell when it comes into contact with ice cream; he also invented a machine to put sticks into lollipops, without which our national lollipop game would be sadly deficient.    In 1953, Just Born bought the Rodda candy company, which was based in nearby Lancaster and produced jelly beans as well as a line of handmade,   marshmallows. Born’s son Bob Born figured out how to mechanize the marshmallow creation process, which shortened the manufacturing time from nearly 27 hours to six minutes. (Bob also ditched the wings that used to be piped onto each Peep, which further streamlined the process.) Not just for Easter anymore             Much like that other   sweet seasonal treat candy corn, Peeps have expanded beyond their original limited availability to become a   sweet. They come in different colors (blue, pink, lavender) flavors (cotton candy, gingerbread, ”lemon delight,”   candy cane) and shapes  —   Peeps bunnies were introduced in the 1980s, and now the line includes hearts, pumpkins, Minions, and more.    But the original yellow chicks (whose flavor is simply ”sugar”) are still the most popular, and the candy is still most commonly associated with Easter. The website WalletHub estimates that 1. 5 billion Peeps are eaten every Easter. And they seem to beat out other common types of Easter candy, at least according to Google search interest.    trends. embed. renderExploreWidget(”TIMESERIES”    ],”category”:0,”property”:””}  );   Still, Peeps are rather divisive. While they have their   fans, many others devote an astonishing amount of energy to railing against them. Take, for instance, the 2012 Guardian article ”Sorry, but Peeps are disgusting,” or the Facebook groups dedicated to Peep hate. Angela Hill of the Oakland Tribune finds them unsettling: I dislike them intensely. And they know it, which merely bolsters their resolve. I can see it in their beady little   eyes  —   their defiance, their sheer pluck. You can’t get just one Peep, you know, and that’s no accident. They come in packs. One might even say, battalions.    And then there’s this vivid description of consuming a Peep, courtesy of the Dallas Observer: ”It’s like eating a tablespoon of sugar lovingly dusted atop a mouthful of your gramma’s cellulite.” They’re useful as food and fun             Peeps are as versatile as their flavor is  . If you’re a Peep purist, you can just eat them straight from the package  —   either fresh or stale and slightly crunchy, as some people prefer. (Matthew Pye, Just Born’s VP of trade relations and corporate affairs, told the Huffington Post that 70 to 75 percent of people prefer ”fresh” Peeps, which still leaves a sizable portion of Peep eaters who opt to consume them on the crunchier side of the   date.) If you’re of legal drinking age, you could pair them with wine or beer. If you want to get creative,   recipes abound, from the relatively innocuous (Peeps Krispies treats) to the elaborate (a Peeps sunflower cake) to the increasingly revolting (”Peepza”  —   literally just Peeps on a pizza  —   and ”Peepshi,” a Willy Wonka fever dream wherein faux sushi is constructed from Peeps, Nerds, Fruit by the Foot, etc. ). Momofuku Milk Bar’s Christina Tosi even suggested skewering them to roast over a fire or flattening them and drying them in the oven to make “Peep chips. ” But if you’d rather not eat them at all, you can still experiment with Peeps in the name of science. One   tradition is to put the candies in the microwave to see what happens. (Spoiler alert: They get big. Sometimes really big.) This practice has also led to the exotic sport known as Peep jousting:  In 1999, Emory University researchers Gary Falcon and James Zimring performed perhaps the most exhaustive Peeps testing in human history, exploring the candies’ durability in the face of a variety of substances. According to the Emory Report:  To test Peep solubility, they began with simple tap water, then moved on to boiling water, then to acetone, sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide, but were left dumbfounded by Peeps’ apparent invulnerability to each. Then they tried Phenol, a   solvent lethal to humans in amounts as small as a single gram. Peeps proved mortal to such a substance  —   well, almost. One hour after plunging an unfortunate Peep into its grisly demise, all that remained in the beaker was a pair of brown carnauba wax eyes floating in a purple Phenol soup.     If you’re more of a   soul, you might consider using the confections to create an artistic masterpiece. In 2006, the Washington Post launched an annual ”Peep Show” diorama contest, asking entrants to create a 3D scene in which all the characters are Peeps. The contest sometimes drew several hundred participants, whose submissions ranged from a Peep van Gogh to a Peepified scene from the movie Up. (You can see past winners of the diorama contest here.) The competition was such a cult favorite that when in 2017 the Post decided to discontinue it, the fine folks at Washington City Paper took it upon themselves to keep the tradition going. (The winner of their contest will be announced in the paper’s April 14 issue.)             But the Post wasn’t even the first newspaper to hold a Peeps contest  —   that honor goes to the St. Paul Pioneer Press, whose staff writer Richard Chin first dreamed up the competition in 2004. And the New Yorker argues that the tradition of   dioramas goes back much further, to the 17th century: By the early Renaissance, inventive European court confectioners were crafting elaborate sculptures for special meals, often designed to echo or compliment the themes of the musical or theatrical entertainments that would accompany a banquet. These could also be allegorical in nature, depicting religious scenes or commemorating military victories. At the wedding of Maria de Medici to Henri IV, in Florence, in 1600, the groom was not in attendance, but he was represented by an impressive sugar sculpture depicting him on horseback. In a less, uh, artful contest, in 2016 Maryland’s National Harbor hosted the first World Peeps Eating Championship. The winner, Matt Stonie of San Jose, took home $3, 500 for consuming an impressive (or disturbing) 200 Peeps in five minutes.  Where do Peeps fall in the Easter candy hierarchy? The website Ranker maintains a fluctuating list of the top Easter candies, which confusingly includes both ”  marshmallow Peeps” and ”bunny Peeps” as separate items. However, that list also considers the unholy monstrosities known as Jordan almonds and thus must be discounted entirely. A Food & Wine ranking from 2014 put Peeps in the top spot above all other drugstore Easter candy, though at least one survey has Reese’s mini eggs at No. 1 and Peeps all the way down in fifth place. But both of these are clearly wrong  —   obviously the reigning Easter candy is and always will be chocolate bunnies. The solid kind. If anyone gives you a hollow chocolate bunny for Easter, thank them politely and then promptly cut them out of your life forever. "
2016-03-28,"’The regime released this video Saturday showing the massive firepower they were using in a bid to retake the city. ’] The Syrian army has been gaining ground in the city for several days now, supported by Russian airstrikes. Syrian state media agency SANA reported Sunday that a military source had announced the army had taken “full control” of the Palmyra. The    city is home to famed   ruins and was once one of Syria’s top tourist destinations. SANA reported army units and armed forces have destroyed key locations used by ISIS throughout the city. Engineering units were said to be combing the city to remove mines and improvised explosive devices. Speaking on state television, Gen. Ali Mayhoub said the fall of Palmyra “directs a fatal blow to the ISIL, undermines the morale of its mercenaries, and ushers in the start of its defeat and retreat,” the Associated Press reported. During a meeting with French lawmakers in Damascus, Syrian President Bashar   hailed his forces’ victory, according to Agence  . “This is an important achievement and fresh proof of the efficiency of the Syrian army and its allies in fighting terrorism,” Assad said. In a statement released Saturday, Russia said it had hit 158 ISIS targets and killed more than 100 militants. The   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported Syrian government forces had regained control of the city for the first time since it was seized by ISIS in May 2015. After days of clashes and intensive bombing by Syrian and Russian warplanes, ISIS fighters had withdrawn from the city, the SOHR reported. The battle for Palmyra had been ongoing for about three weeks and more than 400 ISIS soldiers were killed in the clashes, according to the SOHR. Syria’s Head of Antiquities Mamoun Abdulkarim told the BBC he was overjoyed the city had been retaken. He declared everything ISIS had destroyed would be rebuilt. “I felt a greatest joy in my time when I heard freedom of the city had become a reality,” he said. ISIS militants began destroying the ruins of an ancient temple in the UNESCO World Heritage city in August last year. Described by UNESCO as an “oasis in the Syrian desert,” the World Heritage site of Palmyra features spectacular ruins that were once a “great city that was one of the most important cultural centers of the ancient world. ” However, ISIS fighters seized the city ruins in 2015 and set to work selling off some antiquities on the black market, while destroying other idols and sites, including the famous “Arch of Triumph” that the group believes go against their version of Islam.

2016-03-29,"So the GOP  ’s campaign manager got arrested Tuesday for   from overhead video footage supplied to the police by Donald Trump’s own security folks  —   footage Trump and his campaign had told the world didn’t exist. Now, you could look at this and shrug and say, well, it’s just another day that ends with Y when it comes to Trump. So maybe tomorrow some other aide will mug a nun. Maybe on Friday another will   a disabled veteran. After which comes next Tuesday’s Wisconsin primary, and who is now willing to bet cash dollars Trump will lose that one? Maybe Trump won’t, but this was definitely not just a day ending in Y for the thousands of Republicans who may find themselves appearing on a ballot in November beneath Trump’s name, from the House to the Senate to state legislative seats to mayor’s offices to school boards. For them, it was a day for utter,     panic, featuring screams akin to those heard by the unfortunates on the Titanic: “Where’s my life jacket?” “Every man for himself!” Only their screams are soundless, like Edvard Munch’s famous etching, because they have seven long months before they might drown,   on Election Day. So Trump is standing behind his campaign manager, which fits with his nine months of talking about Megyn Kelly’s menstrual cycle and Carly Fiorina’s supposed ugliness and Heidi Cruz’s    ’  . From one perspective, Trump’s loyalty is endearing. From another, it’s politically insane. Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at   there!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  Look, there are certain facts about American politics that conservatives (like me) don’t enjoy hearing, but which are nonetheless true. Here’s one: Hispanic voters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, are growing in number. Here’s another: Single women, who vote Democratic, are growing in number. Thus, while Trump’s kindness toward Corey Lewandowski may strike some as nice, what’s not so nice for other Republicans is the fact that women made up 54 percent of the voters in 2012. What’s not so nice for Republicans is that Barack Obama won women by 12 percentage points in 2012. What’s not so nice for Republicans is the $50 million ad buy Hillary Clinton’s campaign will make with Trump denying his campaign manager did anything and saying maybe he should get the reporter in question arrested for shouting questions at him. What’s not so nice for Republicans is that Donald Trump will likely turn the gender gap into an abyss deeper than the Marianas Trench. It’s also not so nice that, from a simple   perspective, the GOP   for president has an unfavorability rating among Hispanics nearing 80 percent. I wonder why that is . . . no, I don’t, really. From one perspective, Trump’s loyalty is endearing. From another, it’s politically insane. Mitt Romney got 27 percent of the Hispanic vote when he lost. Anyone want to hazard a guess just how low Trump could go? Ten? Five? There are 14 million Hispanic voters. Trump will lose the GOP another 3 million of them at least. And remember: The party already lost by 5 million in 2012. The basic fact of presidential elections in the United States for the past generation is this: All things being equal, there are more liberal or Democratic voters during presidential years than there are conservative or Republican voters. This was true in 1996, when Bill Clinton got 10 million more votes than Bob Dole. This was true in 2000, when Al Gore and Ralph Nader combined for 3 million more votes than George W. Bush. It was true in 2008, when Barack Obama got 9. 5 million more votes than John McCain. It was true in 2012, when Obama got 5 million more votes than Mitt Romney. This means, simply, that for a Republican to win the presidency in 2016 or ever again, the number of GOP voters has to increase substantially (and the number of Democratic voters has to decline a bit). In order to grow, Republicans have to be more attractive to voters as a general rule. Every Republican running for office in the country who is not in a   Republican state or district knows this to be true. And yet Trump is presiding over a campaign supported by white males  —   the one part of the electorate Republicans have won by landslide margins throughout this period. Trump has claimed the increased turnout of white males in the GOP primaries suggests he can create a stampede of them on Election Day. But even if he somehow does draw 5 million new white male voters to the polls who have never bothered to vote before, he would likely do so while turning a greater number of female and Hispanic voters into Democrats, at least for 2016. Every day that ends in Y, Trump is shrinking the Republican vote."
2016-03-30,"Having long been playing defense on Obamacare because he expanded Medicaid in his state, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) went on the offensive Wednesday and attacked Republicans for promising in the 2014 election cycle that they would repeal Obamacare. “You’ve been supporting conservative candidates,” Kasich said on an appearance on Jay Weber’s Wisconsin radio show, by way of BuzzFeed. “They told you in 2014 they were gonna repeal Obamacare. Do you realize, that’s just —  that’s a big joke?” Kasich also called the 2014 repeal vow ”a stupid promise,” since President Obama would have still been in the White House. ”We’ve got all these conservatives all stirred up and angry because they didn’t keep their word,” he said. Kasich has been pounded throughout the Republican primary for his decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio. The issue came up again at Tuesday’s CNN town hall, where he was questioned by an attendee for choosing a ”  solution.” Kasich defended the move, saying he had a choice: ”Could I bring money back, which is frankly our money, Ohio money, back to Ohio to solve some of our problems.” He pointed to the money saved in Ohio on people who now benefit from the Medicaid expansion, like the mentally ill, drug addicts and the working poor. ”They’re in a better position, they’re not in our prisons, and at the same time, they’re getting on their feet, they’re becoming taxpayers and our Medicaid program is completely under control,” he said. He added, nonetheless, that he did ”reject” Obamacare by refusing to ”go along with the exchange that they were trying to force on me.”"
2016-03-31," The United States women’s national soccer team wants to make clear it is an important force in American soccer, and that it should be paid as such.    Five players from the highly decorated US women’s team (they are the reigning Women’s World Cup and Olympic champions) filed a federal complaint of wage discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Thursday, the New York Times reported. ”We have been quite patient over the years with the belief that the federation would do the right thing and compensate us fairly,” the US women’s team   Carli Lloyd said in a statement released to the Times. The players  —   Lloyd, captain Becky Sauerbrunn, forward Alex Morgan, midfielder Megan Rapinoe, and goalkeeper Hope Solo  —   are trying to show they are an influencing economic factor, their lawyer Jeffrey Kessler told the Times.    American soccer’s governing body, US Soccer, recently released budget figures showing a $20 million increase in revenue  —   which has been attributed to the women’s team’s World Cup win and victory tour. However, US women soccer players can earn as low as 40 percent of what men on the national team rake in, according to the budget figure. ESPN broke down the differences in pay:  Among the numbers cited in the EEOC filing are that the women would earn $99, 000 each if they won 20 friendlies, the minimum number they are required to play in a year. But the men would likely earn $263, 320 each for the same feat, and would get $100, 000 even if they lost all 20 games. Additionally, the women get paid nothing for playing more than 20 games, while the men get between $5, 000 and $17, 625 for each game played beyond 20.     ”Recently, it has become clear that the federation has no intention of providing us equal pay for equal work,” Rapinoe said in a press release announcing the filing. Go deeper:  How women’s tennis also recently fell into another equal pay debate. The highly decorated US women’s soccer team is treated worse than the mediocre US men’s team. Vox’s Emily Crockett shows how.  "
2016-04-01,"’Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that Donald Trump’’s recent comments about abortion were ”outrageous” and dismissed his ”unconvincing” attempt to walk them back.’ ’In an interview with Henry Blodget, Business Insider’’s CEO and editor in chief, Clinton took aim at the Republican presidential frontrunner’’s  over whether there should be ”some sort of punishment” for women who get abortions if the US outlawed the practice.’ ’”It was outrageous that he would be advocating for women who exercise their constitutional right and have autonomy over their healthcare decisions would be criminals along with the doctors that served them,” Clinton said during an interview at SUNY Purchase College in New York. ”He did try to walk it back  —   I think pretty unconvincingly. ”’ ’Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, said that Trump also revealed what many Republican lawmakers and candidates believe. She cited efforts by GOP governors and state legislatures to curb access to abortion.’ ’”What’’s important here is that all the Republicans agree with him. They all want to see women’’s rights eroded and for abortion to become illegal again,” she said. ”That’’s why so many state Republican governors and legislators are defunding Planned Parenthood and shutting down clinics that not only provide a safe abortion, but HIV testing, cancer screenings, and so much else. ”’ ’She continued:’ ’’ ”After sparking the firestorm, Trump’s campaign soon issued a statement reversing his position on which people should be punished for having abortions if the procedure were banned. Trump then said that it should be those who perform the abortions, not the women who receive them.” ’In a Fox News interview on Thursday, Trump admitted that ”it could be that I misspoke” on the topic.’ ”Even many conservatives attempted to distance themselves from Trump’s initial proposal. Antiabortion groups . And Trump’s two Republican opponents said that the frontrunner had revealed his naïveté on the issue.” ’”Once again Donald Trump has demonstrated that he hasn’’t seriously thought through the issues, and he’’ll say anything just to get attention,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump’’s top primary rival.’ ’Cruz added: ”Of course we shouldn’’t be talking about punishing women; we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they have to bring life into the world. ”’ ’Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that Donald. ..’"
2016-04-02," In one of his sharpest rebukes yet against Donald Trump, President Obama said Friday the Republican presidential candidate “doesn’t know much” about foreign policy, nuclear proliferation or “the world generally,” The comments came at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, where he was asked about comments Trump recently made about Japan and South Korea developing their own nuclear weapons. “The person who made the statements doesn’t know much about foreign policy, or nuclear policy, or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally,” Obama said during a press conference. “I said before, people pay attention to American elections. ” Trump has suggested that Japan and South Korea should develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent to North Korean military ambitions, an argument he’s made to reduce U. S. military presence in the area. Obama noted that Trump’s comments came up during his discussions with world leaders in Washington during the summit. “We don’t want someone in the Oval Office who doesn’t recognize how important that is,” he said. Trump has made other comments about nuclear weapons that have made headlines in recent days, including saying he would not rule out using nuclear bombs in Europe. Obama said even countries who are used to a “carnival atmosphere” in their own politics are looking for “sobriety and clarity” in the U. S.  "
2016-04-03," While admitting his controversial comments last week on women and abortion    and the subsequent      may have taken a toll on his campaign going into Tuesday’s Wisconsin primary, Republican presidential   Donald Trump also took to the airwaves Sunday to defend equally controversial statements that NATO was “obsolete” and that South Korea and Japan “would be better off” if they had nuclear weapons. In recent days, the   candidate retweeted an unflattering picture of primary rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s wife and suggested NATO is obsolete and “some form of punishment” is needed for women who have abortions if the procedure were illegal. “I could have done without the tweet,” Trump told “Fox News Sunday. ” Trump wouldn’t agree that he made a mistake on the abortion question, but said, “As a hypothetical question, I would have rather answered it in a different manner. ” He eventually issued two statements to clarify his comments. Those mistakes appear to be hurting him in Wisconsin, which holds its primary on Tuesday, and with women voters, a key voting bloc in the general election. The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → Most polls show Trump trailing Cruz in Wisconsin, after leading him by   in late February. And a recent   poll shows 70 percent of women have an unfavorable view of him. However, Trump on Sunday held firm on his position that NATO has become obsolete. He said the international peacekeeping force doesn’t focus enough on stopping terrorism and that the United States pays too much for what it gets in return. “It’s obsolete,” Trump said. “We’re not getting the benefits that we should be getting for the money. We’re carrying a lot of countries.   …     What I said was exactly right.   …     I think NATO has to be readjusted. ” Trump also stuck by his suggestion that it’s perhaps time for the U. S. to stop paying most of the bill to defend Japan and South Korea against   North Korea, even if that means touching off a nuclear arms race in the Korean peninsula. “You have Pakistan and you have North Korea. And you have China. And you have Russia. And you have India. And you have the United States and many other countries have nukes,” Trump said. “You already have a nuclear arms race. ” Trump has run his campaign since June in an unabashed style in which he has risen in the polls in part with unapologetic remarks about deporting roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States and a call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants. On Sunday, the New York real estate magnate still expressed confidence about doing well in Wisconsin and winning the party nomination. He acknowledged, however, being a politician for just eight months and having a “learning curve. ” He also remained defiant regarding his decision to defend campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who has been charged with misdemeanor battery for allegedly grabbing the arm of a female reporter. Trump said the reporter, Michelle Fields, originally and falsely claimed she was nearly knocked to the ground and that Lewandowski is a “good, honest man. ” “The easier thing would have been: ‘Corey, you’re fired. You’re not very good at that, OK?’ But I don’t want to ruin him . . . I don’t want to destroy him,” Trump said.     "
2016-04-04," Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said on Monday he is ”comfortable” with the current stance of U. S. monetary policy, and expects ”moderate” economic growth ahead.  Kashkari took the top job at the Fed’s smallest bank in January, shortly after the Fed raised its benchmark policy rate for the first time in nearly a decade. Policymakers have left rates between 0. 25 percent and 0. 5 percent at each meeting since then.  ”My view is, let’s put people back to work as long as we have room on inflation,” Kashkari, who does not vote on monetary policy until next year, told reporters. Asked his view on the current stance of monetary policy, he said, ”I think it’s about right. ..Right now I’m comfortable, but let’s see how the economy evolves.”  Kashkari, who unlike many of his fellow Fed policymakers is not an economist, rarely talks about monetary policy, but the views expressed Monday suggest he supports Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s patient approach to raising rates. But he did say he found the March jobs data ”compelling” in that it showed more people are returning to the work force.  ”That’s a good thing and we should let that process continue while inflation is running below our target,” he said.  ROBUST, PASSIONATE Kashkari spoke to reporters at the end of an   symposium he had convened at his bank’s Minneapolis headquarters, entitled ”Ending Too Big to Fail.”  It was the first of several conferences he plans this year to air and vet ways to reduce the likelihood of government bailouts of banks when the next financial crisis rolls around. He plans to release a proposal with solutions by the end of the year. Economists and regulators from several of the Fed’s 12 regional banks, as well as from the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, made the trip to attend the conference in Minneapolis.  St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who also attended the session, expressed disbelief at the ”breathtaking” support among many of the session’s panelists for the current state of U. S. banking regulation.  Bullard said the Fed needs conferences like Kashkari’s to figure out how best to keep the U. S. financial system safe.  ”This couldn’t have been done inside the Beltway,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference, referring to the road that runs around the perimeter of Washington D. C.  Among ideas mooted at Monday’s conference were requiring banks to hold more capital, breaking up any bank with more than $350 billion in assets, imposing fees on banks seen as risky, and changing bank governance. The discussion was spirited, with one public spat between Anat Admati, a professor at Stanford University and a critic of big banks, and former Fed Governor Randy Kroszner, that continued in loud tones even after the two left the lunch session.  ”This was a much more robust and passionate discussion frankly than I was expectation,” Kasha said. ”Some people thought we were going to cook this.

2016-04-05," Tom Staggs, the veteran Walt Disney Co executive who had been widely seen as the media company’s next CEO, will step down on May 6 as the board expands its search for a successor to Bob Iger, Disney said on Monday. The unexpected move came little more than a year after Staggs had been promoted to chief operating officer, and about two years before Iger, Disney’s chief executive and chairman, is due to retire. A source with knowledge of the situation said Staggs, 55, had learnt he was not guaranteed the CEO job and that the board was going to broaden its search for a new leader. Staggs and the company mutually decided he should step down, said the source, who requested anonymity because the reasons were not announced.  Disney, which operates television networks, theme parks and a movie studio, said in a statement that the board aimed to evaluate a ”robust slate of candidates.” Iger has led Disney to record profits and executed successful acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and ”Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm Ltd. But he recently acknowledged subscriber declines at Disney’s sports network ESPN, raising concern among investors about how the channel would adapt to online streaming technology that is rapidly drawing viewers away from traditional TV. Disney’s board may have decided the company needs a new CEO with more experience in technology to navigate that change, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said in an interview. ”How do you transition to that five, 10, 15 years out?” said Diedrich, who recommends buying Disney shares. ”There may be a need there for someone who has more experience with that consumer trend that is certainly here to stay.” Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who sits on the Disney board, has been seen as a potential CEO candidate. Facebook declined to comment. Iger, 65, has insisted that he would retire from Disney in June 2018, though the board previously convinced him to extend his contract twice after he announced plans to leave.  Disney’s shares fell 1. 5 percent to $97. 18 in   trading on Monday. The company promoted Staggs to COO in February 2015 from his post as head of Disney’s theme parks and resorts and following a previous stint as chief financial officer. While Disney never referred to him as the heir apparent, his move into the No. 2 job put him in the lead to ascend to CEO. One of his biggest projects was the building of Shanghai Disneyland, which is scheduled to open in June. Staggs will remain employed by Disney as a special adviser to Iger through the company’s fiscal year, which goes through September, Disney said. He joined Disney in 1990 after working in investment banking at Morgan Stanley & Co. CFO Jay Rasulo, who had been seen as Staggs’ chief rival for the top position, said last June that he would step down.

2016-04-06,"PayPal has reportedly announced it will cancel plans for a $3. 6 million expansion in Charlotte, North Carolina as a response to the passage of a bill aimed at protecting women and girls from having their bathroom and shower privacy invaded by biological men. [The backlash against North Carolina has been immense with the NBA threatening to remove its   Game and major corporations making complaints and threats.  While PayPal is offended by the North Carolina law, PayPall is apparently fine allowing its services to be used in countries where homosexuals really are persecuted, some of them unto death. According to a screenshot taken of the PayPal website and circulated by North Carolina Values Coalition, PayPal does business in Nigeria, Zambia, Yemen, Somalia, and other countries where those who act out   sexual activity are severely punished, including the death penalty, and some that do not even allow public advocacy: PayPal is not the only corporate hypocrite when it comes to the homosexual agenda. Apple, for instance, has also attacked states that have religious freedom bills that protect individuals and businesses from having to participate in weddings they deem morally objectionable. However, “Apple has numerous Apple Shops and Apple Premium Resellers in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia  —   one of ten countries in which gays are regularly executed. ”"

2016-04-08,"In a major document released Friday, Pope Francis addressed divisive elements of Catholic doctrine  —   including how to treat couples who remarry after a divorce that wasn’t annulled by the church, and the church’s stance on contraception. Without issuing any new   doctrine, Francis said that priests should focus on providing pastoral care for Catholic couples, rather than sitting in judgment of them, and that individual conscience should be emphasized, rather than dogmatic rules. The document  —   a   apostolic exhortation called ”Amoris Laetitia,” or ”The Joy of Love”  —   is more than 250 pages long. In it, the pope emphasizes that life is more complicated than religious law. In the opening pages, he invokes the values of ”generosity, commitment, fidelity and patience,” but also says he wishes to ”encourage everyone to be a sign of mercy and closeness wherever family life remains imperfect or lacks peace and joy.” He explains that in Amoris Laetitia, in addition to considering scripture, he will ”examine the actual situation of families, in order to keep firmly grounded in reality.” And he notes that Jesus set forth a demanding ideal for his followers  —   but ”never failed to show compassion and closeness to the frailty of individuals.” Joshua McElwee of the National Catholic Reporter told NPR’s Morning Edition that the exhortation has a very different tone than previous church pronouncements on these subjects. The focus on ”conscience” as a determining factor is key, McElwee says. He explains what that means in this context: ”That’s something that the church talked about 50 years ago, but the last couple of popes did not expand upon. And what Pope Francis is saying is that conscience means that people can be hearing something from God, kind of in the depths of their heart, that may even be not quite in accord with what the church teaches generally, as a general norm, but can still be true and can still be discerned to be God’s will in their life. So he’s allowing for a little bit of discord between individual cases and the general church teaching.” On Divorce, When it comes to divorce and remarriage, McElwee says, the pope doesn’t directly change church law  —   which holds that couples who divorce and remarry without getting a Catholic annulment are committing adultery and cannot receive communion. ”But he kind of pivots the church stance, asking clergy to be much more pastoral and not always apply one general norm to all cases  —   but instead help people discern what God is doing in their lives, even if they might be living in a situation the church in past years might have called irregular,” McElwee says. No longer can the church simply say everyone in such an ”irregular situation” is living in mortal sin, McElwee explains. Instead, each individual situation will need to be looked at separately. ”So, it’s a very different stance, and it’s allowing clergy to let people discern God’s will, even in situations where that might be what, what he says, ’morally confusing,’ ” McElwee says. Some in the Catholic Church wanted the pope to say it’s OK for remarried people to take communion others wanted ”a very strong no,” McElwee says. ”And what the pope has done really is seemed to embrace the middle path, looking for ambiguity, for individual situations.” On Contraception, Francis didn’t describe any methods of contraception as ”unlawful,” as previous Catholic encyclicals have, The Associated Press notes. Instead of characterizing contraception as a sin, Francis says the church must emphasize to young couples the joy of having children  —   while respecting the need for each couple to decide their family size on their own. He cites the Relatio Finalis, written by bishops last year: ”In accord with the personal and fully human character of conjugal love, family planning fittingly takes place as the result a consensual dialogue between the spouses, respect for times and consideration of the dignity of the partner. . .. Decisions involving responsible parenthood presupposes the formation of conscience.” As well as the Second Vatican Council: ”Let them thoughtfully take into account both their own welfare and that of their children, those already born and those which the future may bring. . .. They should consult the interests of the family group, of temporal society and of the Church herself. The parents themselves and no one else should ultimately make this judgment in the sight of God.” ”Francis made a single reference to the   family planning method of abstaining from sex during a woman’s fertile time,” the AP writes. ”He said only that such practices are to be ’promoted’  —   not that other methods are forbidden  —   and he insisted on the need for children to receive sex education, albeit without focusing on ’safe sex.’ ” On Sex, Homosexuality And Gender, Francis rejected the idea that sexual desire is a thing to be ”eliminated” or looked down upon. ”God himself created sexuality, which is a marvelous gift to his creatures,” he wrote. He writes that sex and eroticism can be distorted  —   including when people instruct women to submit to their husbands, or sex becomes either selfish or purely  . But reciprocal and respectful sex, within the context of marriage, is a passion that reveals ”the marvels of which the human heart is capable,” Francis writes. The pope also said that a ”great variety” of family situations can offer stability, while emphasizing that   marriage or unmarried committed relationships are not equal to marriage in the eyes of the Church. The document references transgender people, saying that while there are ”at times understandable aspirations” to ideologies that allow for a separation of gender and biological sex, they are attempting to ”sunder what are inseparable aspects of reality.” The pope calls for women’s rights to be advanced around the world and rejected the idea that feminism has hurt family structures. ”The equal dignity of men and women makes us rejoice to see old forms of discrimination disappear,” he wrote. On Marriage, The Church And The World, On marriage in general, the pope writes that the Catholic Church needs ”a healthy dose of  ” for the way it has described and presented marriage to the public. ”[W]e often present marriage in such a way that its unitive meaning, its call to grow in love and its ideal of mutual assistance are overshadowed by an almost exclusive insistence on the duty of procreation . .. At times we have also proposed a far too abstract and almost artificial theological ideal of marriage, far removed from the concrete situations and practical possibilities of real families. . .. ”[W]e have often been on the defensive, wasting pastoral energy on denouncing a decadent world without being proactive in proposing ways of finding true happiness.” The pope also addressed a wide range of challenges that affect families, including: poverty migration children with special needs elderly relatives who need care drug use and alcoholism domestic violence and a lack of affordable housing as well as social pressures and the difficulty of addressing marital problems. ”The Synod’s reflections show us that there is no stereotype of the ideal family,” he writes, ”but rather a challenging mosaic made up of many different realities, with all their joys, hopes and problems. ”"
2016-04-09,"Princeton, N. J.  —   One of history’s most important battles happened here on a field you can walk across in less than half the 45 or so minutes the battle lasted. If George Washington’s audacity on January 3, 1777, had not reversed the patriots’ retreat and routed the advancing British, the American Revolution might have been extinguished. Yet such is America’s neglect of some places that sustain its defining memories, the portion of the field over which Washington’s   charge passed is being bulldozed to make way for houses for faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS). To understand the gravity of this utterly unnecessary desecration, you must understand the astonishingly underestimated Battle of Princeton. But from there, on Christmas night, he crossed the Delaware River ice floes for a successful   (at most) attack on Britain’s Hessian mercenaries at Trenton. This was Washington’s first victory he had not been at Lexington, Concord, or Bunker Hill. Trenton would, however, have been merely an evanescent triumph, were it not for what happened ten days later. The most lethal weapons in this war were bayonets. The British had them. Few Americans did, and they beat a panicked retreat from the advancing steel. By his personal bravery, Washington reversed this and led a charge. An unusually tall man sitting on a large white horse, he was a clear target riding as close to British lines as first base is to home plate. Biographer Ron Chernow writes that, at Princeton, Washington was a “warrior in the antique sense. The   battlefield was a compact space, its cramped contours defined by the short range of muskets and bayonet charges, giving generals a chance to inspire by their immediate presence. ” When the redcoats ran, the British aura of invincibility and the strategy of “securing territory and handing out pardons” (Chernow) were shattered. And the drift of American opinion toward defeatism halted. Share article on FacebookshareTweet In his   biography of Washington, James Thomas Flexner said: “The British historian George Trevelyan was to write concerning Trenton: ‘It may be doubted whether so small a number of men ever employed so short a space of time with greater and more lasting effects upon the history of the world.’ But such would not have been the result if Washington had not gone on to overwhelm Princeton. ” RELATED: The Civil War of 1776: An English War for American Independence, This ground, on which patriots’ blood puddled on that   morning, has been scandalously neglected by New Jersey. Now it is being vandalized by the Institute for Advance Study, which has spurned a $4. 5 million purchase offer  —   more than $1 million above the appraised value  —   from the invaluable Civil War Trust, which is expanding its preservation activities to Revolutionary War sites. In today’s academia there are many scholars against scholarship, including historians hostile to history  —   postmodernists who think the past is merely a social construct reflecting the present’s preoccupations, or power structures, or something. They partake of academia’s preference for a multicultural future of diluted, if not extinguished, nationhood, and they dislike commemorating history made by white men with guns. The IAS engaged a historian who wrote a report clotted with today’s impenetrable academic patois. He says we should not “fetishize space,” and he drapes disparaging quotation marks around the words “hallowed ground. ” SLIDESHOW: Signers of the Declaration of Independence, The nation owes much to the IAS, which supported Albert Einstein, physicist Robert Oppenheimer, and the diplomat and historian George F. Kennan. It is especially disheartening that a distinguished institution of scholars is indifferent to preserving a historic site that can nourish national identity. The battle to save this battlefield, one of the nation’s most significant and most neglected sites, is not yet lost. The government in today’s Trenton, and in the city named for the man who won the 1777 battle, should assist the Civil War Trust.,"
2016-04-10," Scanning a bank statement into a computer may not sound particularly   but it’s unsettling some of Asia’s private bankers. By aggregating all the monthly statements mailed to high net worth individuals on the multiple accounts they hold at different institutions, Singapore   Mesitis offers clients a single window on their holdings. ”There’s a need for this,” says Pooja Gurbani, a Singaporean in her 30s who handles tens of millions of dollars of family money. ”It makes us see more, it makes us more intelligent investors.”  With 4. 7 million high net worth individuals   typically those with $1 million in liquid financial assets      is the largest and fastest growing wealth region, according to Cap Gemini and RBC. But its private banking industry is only slowly waking up to the demands of a new,   generation of wealthy clients and family offices, creating opportunities for financial technology, or fintech,  . Gurbani said she was so impressed with the Mesitis service that she ditched her private banker and even invested in the firm, one of a handful of   across Asia looking to disrupt the traditional wealth management business. For sure, sending statements to a third party and viewing holdings online won’t appeal to everyone, especially ultra high net worth individuals   those with at least $30 million of investable assets   and Mesitis says it is not regulated. DIGITAL INTEGRATION Feeding paper statements into a scanner may seem   but it gets around the lack of application programming interfaces (APIs) that many banks and financial institutions in the United States offer to allow   access to data. That level of digital integration hasn’t taken off in Asia, prompting regulators such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to prod banks to do more. ”You don’t really have a choice because we’re already here,” Mesitis’   and CEO Tanmai Sharma told a recent banking event hosted by the MAS. ”This is   and absurdly easy.” Sharma’s company is now running trials at three private banks to integrate its software into their systems, but he says most of his firm’s business is directly with banks’ clients. Private banks are cautiously taking note. Clients in Asia are digitally   and the region’s billionaire wealth will overtake that of the U. S. within a decade, a UBS study predicts. UBS, the world’s biggest wealth manager, is evaluating Mesitis’ Canopy service, Ketan Samani, chief digital officer at UBS Wealth Management APAC, told Reuters. Indeed, UBS and others such as Standard Chartered are building their own fintech teams. Inside a   building that once served as the British military headquarters in Singapore, UBS is   new technologies to serve its wealthy clients in Asia. Credit Suisse has a mobile app tailored for its   private banking clients. Samani sees the main threat from   fintech disrupters in payments, lending and credit cards. ”All those are under attack now.   players have come in and the barriers have lowered to some degree,” he said. But UBS and other private banks hope their core advisory business   built around    meetings   will escape the onslaught.  ”We are moving towards being paid for advice, with new products coming in regardless of the number of transactions the clients are making and so on,” said Geoffroy De Ridder, operating head for UBS Wealth Management in Asia Pacific. CHIPPING AWAY Offering advice may not, however, be as safe as it looks.   ’ ’ automate wealth advisory roles, calling into question the value of traditional   meetings, and potentially threatening an important source of bank income. Some Asian bankers are dismissive. ”They’re kind of just algorithms in the sky, they’re pretty dumb,” said Neal Cross, chief innovation officer for DBS, a Singapore bank which spends close to $700 million a year on technology. He was speaking in December. Mesitis’ Sharma, a former managing director at Deutsche Bank, believes the opposite. He says   will chip away at both businesses by aggregating customers’ data and offering smarter insights on their investments. ”Robo is a logical offshoot of the aggregation business we do,” said Sharma. ”We have the data anyway, so using that data to make efficient investment portfolios is a logical next step.”  (Reporting by Jeremy Wagstaff and Saeed Azhar, with additional reporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Lisa Jucca and Ian Geoghegan) SAO PAULO Financial technology firms in Brazil are targeting lending to   and   companies to fill a gap in the credit market left by large lenders deterred by rising delinquencies and narrow margins.

2016-04-11,"In March, the Islamic Society of Wichita rescinded an invitation to Monzer Taleb, a longtime sympathizer of Hamas, the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and a formally designated terrorist organization under American law. Taleb was to speak at a fundraiser, but the Islamic Society canceled his appearance when community members protested and Representative Mike Pompeo (R. Kan.) publicly raised questions about the matter. The Wichita Eagle covered the controversy. In my opinion, the paper’s reporting stressed the allegations of “Islamophobia” posited by Islamist sympathizers in reaction to the protests. The paper also  focused on what it described as “a trend by   militias of targeting Muslims. ” The impropriety of a prominent Islamic organization’s decision to give a platform to an apologist for a terrorist organization seemed of, at best, secondary importance. Consequently, last Thursday (April 7) I submitted a proposed   to the Wichita Eagle. This weekend, a member of the paper’s editorial board informed me that the paper believed it had adequately covered the matter and therefore had decided to decline my  . I have reproduced it, below.  As a federal prosecutor in 1993, when I led the investigation and trial of a jihadist cell that had bombed the World Trade Center and plotted an even more ambitious attack on New York City landmarks, the first Muslims I encountered were not terrorists. They were  : patriots who embraced America and Western liberty. They helped us infiltrate the cell, thwart the jihadist plots (including the planned attacks in Manhattan) and convict the terrorists. The Muslim Brotherhood and its Palestinian branch, Hamas, which is a terrorist organization and has been formally recognized as such under American law for some 20 years, are on the wrong side of that divide. Representative Mike Pompeo did the people of Kansas  —   both   and Muslim Americans  —   a great service by calling out the Islamic Society of Wichita (ISW) on its indefensible invitation to Monzer Taleb, a Hamas sympathizer, to speak at a fundraising event. RELATED: It’s Not ‘Islamaphobic’ to Protest a   Speaker, The Brotherhood’s   mission was laid bare by the Justice Department in the 2007 —  08 Holy Land Foundation   prosecution  —   a scheme that funneled millions of dollars to Hamas. Internal Brotherhood memoranda explained that the organization, in its own words, is engaged in a “grand jihad” to “eliminate and destroy Western civilization from within. ” Its methodology, since its founding in Egypt in the 1920s, is to bore into cities and towns,   mosques and community centers as their movement’s “axis. ” Share article on FacebookshareTweet As we proved in our terrorism prosecution in the 1990s, communities thus taken over by radicals become hubs for terrorist fundraising, training, and other means of material and moral support. Recent events in Paris and Brussels underscore that violent jihadism thrives in   communities that sympathize with the terrorists’ aims, or where people who might object are intimidated into silence. It is therefore essential to our national security, and to the ability of   Muslims to practice their faith free from Islamist intimidation, that we identify, marginalize, and reject terrorist sympathizers. Representative Pompeo did just that. RELATED: Incubators of Islamic Supremacism, Monzer Taleb is not a closet Hamas sympathizer. He has been open and notorious in his support for this   organization that, by its charter, pledges to destroy Israel by violent jihad. As proof in the Holy Land Foundation case demonstrated, Hamas has acted on this pledge since its inception in the late 1980s. The principal activity of the Brotherhood’s network of American Islamist organizations has been to support Hamas. The Brotherhood backed Hamas and its intifada through “Palestine Committees” in the West. Taleb was a Palestinian Committee member. He even performed in a band that sang   songs  —   and, indeed, the band’s leader, Mufid Abdel Qader, was ultimately convicted of providing material support to terrorism and of money laundering.

It takes less than three minutes of Internet research to learn about Taleb’s Hamas ties. It is doubtful such research should be necessary since those ties explain his popularity in radical circles. Rather than whining about “Islamophobia,” which only fuels suspicion that the ISW’s leadership is using the Brotherhood playbook, the ISW should alleviate concerns by condemning Hamas. To be clear, this does not mean they should condemn “terrorism”  —   the Brotherhood is always happy to do this because it rationalizes that Israel is the real terrorist. It means naming names: Hamas. In the battle against radical Islam,   Muslims who seek peace stand firmly against Hamas, a terrorist organization, material support of which is a felony under American law. It should not be hard to correct any misimpression caused by the Taleb invitation. ISW just needs to stand unequivocally against Hamas, joining Representative Pompeo and scores of other patriots.  —   Andrew C.

2016-04-12,"House Speaker Paul Ryan put to rest any lingering hopes that he would jump into the Republican presidential race on Tuesday, saying in a press conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters, ”count me out.” ”Let me be clear: I do not want, nor will I accept the Republican nomination,” Ryan said. ”I am not going to be our party’s nominee.” Ryan said he was aware of ”more speculation” that someone not currently running would be the GOP nominee during his recent trip to the Middle East. But he said his role in the House is too critical to allow such rumors to continue. ”We have too much work to do in the House to allow this speculation swirl or have my motivations questioned,” he said. ”As Speaker of the House, I believe I have not just an opportunity, but an obligation to advance [the] debate.” Ryan, who will chair the national summer convention, also directly addressed party delegates about a possible brokered convention. ”If no candidate has a majority on the first ballot, I believe that you should only choose from a person who has actually participated in the primary. Count me out,” he said. The House Speaker went on to say he believes you should choose to run for President if you wish to be considered, which he has not. ”I simply believe that if you want to be the nominee  —   to be the president  —   you should actually run for it. I chose not to. Therefore, I should not be considered. Period,” he said. ”So, let me say again, I’m not going to be our party’s nominee.” Ryan was long viewed as a possible white knight for a party caught between a rock and a hard place, otherwise known as Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). The Tuesday press conference was also far from the first time Ryan has forcefully denied any intention of running for the party’s nomination, even in the event of a brokered summer convention. But after Ryan’s office put out a   video spot last week that looked an awful lot like a campaign ad, rumors again swirled that Ryan would charge into the race. The Wisconsin congressman has clashed with party frontrunner Donald Trump, and been forced to publicly admonish the billionaire for his delayed denouncement of an endorsement from a former KKK leader and his proposed ban on Muslim immigration.

2016-04-13," WASHINGTON  —   When North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed a controversial LGBT law, dozens of major corporations quickly came out and condemned it, telling him in a letter they were “disappointed” in his decision to “sign this discriminatory legislation into law. ” But many of those companies and influential trade associations that represent them will likely continue to financially support the group backing McCrory’s   bid, the Republican Governors Association. RGA, which is set up as a 527 political organization and therefore eligible for corporate donations, has raised millions over the years from companies such as Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Dow Chemical, Pfizer, Citigroup, and Pepsi Co.  —   all of whom signed a letter to McCrory last month criticizing the law, which limits protections for the LGBT community and requires people to use bathrooms based on the sex listed on their birth certificate. McCrory attempted to clarify the law on Tuesday, allowing private companies to set their own policies on restrooms, but his executive order kept the contentious elements intact. Although the group supports Republican governors across the country, RGA will spend a significant amount of its resources in 2016 focusing on the Tar Heel state. McCrory’s   battle against Democrat Roy Cooper is expected be one of the closest gubernatorial contests in the country this cycle. Another state where the RGA will spend some resources is Indiana, where some of the same companies criticized Indiana Gov. Mike Pence’s decision to sign a religious freedom law last year. BuzzFeed News reached out to nearly two dozen companies and trade groups that have given to RGA in the past to become corporate members of the group and have come out against the North Carolina law. None of them said they would be making any changes in their giving over the law. (Felicia McLemore, a spokeswoman for Marriott International, was the only one to say the company “did not anticipate making such contributions this year,” but said that wasn’t necessarily a result of the law). A few, including   tech company Cisco, said their giving would continue. “Cisco has had equal membership in both the Republican and Democratic Governors Associations for many years,” said spokeswoman Andrea Duffy said in an email. “Our involvement has never been about any specific party or candidate,” Duffy wrote. “We use our memberships to educate members on issues of importance to the tech industry and our funds are directed towards   purposes. We anticipate continued focus on these areas, and don’t expect our support to go up or down based on partisan topics. ” On Wednesday, Duffy said that the company sends a letter yearly to both RGA and DGA s directed toward   purposes. Others either declined to comment on their plans to give to RGA, beyond their public criticism of the law, or did not respond to repeated calls and emails. RGA also declined to comment. Most major companies looking to influence policy or maintain their relationship with lawmakers on the state level typically give to both Democratic and Republican gubernatorial groups. Although they didn’t waste any time in criticizing McCrory’s decision, not giving to to the RGA  —   especially at a time when Republicans control the majority of statehouses and governorships  —   is a much more difficult decision. Companies could risk missing out on facetime with governors and further straining the party’s coalition of   and social conservatives, GOP fundraisers say. Even though shareholders for public corporations are becoming increasingly curious about political giving, it could set a precedent where companies have   their contributions anytime there’s a controversial bill. “These big corporations have been acting in bad faith,” said Brad Todd, a GOP consultant who worked for  . Thom Tillis’ campaign in North Carolina in 2014, about the business community siding with the left on religious and LGBT issues. “Large businesses would be wise to be very careful. ” McCrory signed the bill late last month in response to an ordinance from Charlotte allowing transgender people to use bathrooms based on the gender they identify with. The passage of the law has already resulted in PayPal canceling plans to invest in the state, which could reportedly cost North Carolina 400 jobs. Musicians like Bruce Springsteen have also canceled appearances in the state, citing the law. Despite the criticism and attacks from Democrats, Republicans who have experience handling statewide races in North Carolina insist McCrory made the right political calculation  —   one that might seem odd outside of the Tar Heel state but makes sense in a purple state that still has a sizable number of conservative Democrats. Republicans point to a survey by   think tank Civitas Institute, which found in a poll that 69% of those surveyed believed the Charlotte ordinance to be “unreasonable and unsafe. ” Most acknowledge that it wasn’t ideal for this issue to come up in an election year, but believe the Republican base would have viewed vetoing the bill as McCrory caving. Some are even pushing back on attacks that McCrory is hurting the state’s economy by blaming the companies, alleging they are being hypocritical in condemning the North Carolina law while continuing to operate and invest in countries with bad human rights records. “They do business in Cuba, which has a horrible human rights record,” said Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, when asked about PayPal. “People don’t want PayPal telling them what to do when it comes to their kids bathrooms and locker rooms. ” Ferrell Blount, a businessman and former NC GOP chairman, made a similar argument: “Bank of America operates in Saudi Arabia. I mean we know what goes on in Saudi Arabia with gay people. ”  "
2016-04-14,"As the New York primary approaches, Empire State residents with international connections may wish to consider the implications of a Donald Trump presidency for lands overseas that are dear to many of their hearts. Trump wants to gut NATO. He has openly expressed admiration for Russian revanchist strongman Vladimir Putin, and he has hired several   persons as his top advisors. These include Carter Page, an investor in the Russian gas giant, Gazprom, and a vocal supporter of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Paul Manafort, a henchman of deposed Ukrainian dictator Victor Yanukovych, on whose behalf Putin’s invasion was initiated. Furthermore, Trump has been endorsed by Aleksandr Dugin, the totalitarian “Eurasianist” philosopher and geostrategist, and a leading advocate for the policy of expanding Russia into a transcontinental Eurasian bloc incorporating most of Europe and Asia. Let’s start with Poland. Polish independence was extinguished in the late 18th century, and with the exception of a   period between the wars was not fully recovered until the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989. Putin wants to restore the Soviet bloc, or at the very least, the Czarist empire, which included not only Ukraine, but most of Poland, and the Baltic states as well. This means that, as far as Putin is concerned, Polish independence must be crushed. His potential methods for achieving this objective include both military and economic means. RELATED: Is NATO Worth Preserving? Share article on FacebookshareTweet An outright attack by the Russian army might not even be necessary to crush Poland: Putin has other means at his disposal, with the most obvious being to deny Poland gas supplies.

The sole purpose of this project, dubbed by Polish leaders the “  Pipeline” after the infamous pact that allied Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union to crush Poland in 1939, is to allow Russia to cut off gas supplies to Poland without having to lose revenue from gas sales to Germany and western Europe at the same time. RELATED: To Counter Putin, More Spending and More Resolve, Would the Germans, if left to their own devices, be willing to collude with Russia’s absolutist rulers once again to divide Poland between them? Who knows? But the fact that the question even needs to be asked shows the extreme danger that Poland would once again face should Trump’s policy of American disengagement from NATO be pursued. The situation of the Baltic states, which lack the military capacity to put up even a semblance of a fight, would be even more perilous. More Vladimir Putin Qaddafi’s ‘good’ son, c. Insult to Injury (and Murder) Boris Nemtsov’s Legacy Haunts Putin’s RussiaAnother country that a Trump administration would place in existential danger is Israel. While Trump’s statement that he would act as a neutral arbiter between Israel and the Palestinians has received some attention, the much greater threat to the Jewish state comes from Trump’s desire to align America with Putin’s Russia. This is so because Russia’s Middle East strategy is centered on building up an Iranian empire stretching from Lebanon to Afghanistan as a powerful junior partner to Moscow in the planned Eurasian bloc. This strategy has been facilitated by the Obama administration’s decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, to give the Tehran government hundreds of billions of dollars to expand its reach and develop nuclear weapons, and to allow the     Bashar   regime in Syria to massacre its way toward victory without substantial impediment. Consistent with his   tilt, Trump has stated that the United States should back the   client Assad, as well. Thus a Trump administration offers Israel the terrifying prospect of a   Iranian regional hegemon, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Hindu Kush, backed by Russia and unopposed by the United States. A Trump presidency could lead to the end of Poland’s independence and Israel’s existence.

2016-04-15," A California review board recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten on Thursday, more than 40 years after she was sent to prison for her role in the murder of a wealthy couple in 1969. The recommendation by the California Board of Parole must still undergo further review before it is sent to Gov. Jerry Brown, who has the final say. He has previously denied parole for another Manson family member, the Associated Press reported. As the youngest Manson follower involved in the string of Los Angeles killings, attorneys for Van Houten have argued that she should face less blame for her actions. She was 19 at the time and under the influence of LSD. Van Houten’s attorney, Rich Pfeiffer, told the AP that she is not a danger to the public and should be freed. “The only violent thing she has ever done in her entire life was this crime and that was under the control of Charles Manson,” he said. “She is just not a public safety risk, and when you are not a public safety risk, the law says you shall be released. ” On Aug. 10, 1969, Van Houten and others entered the Los Feliz home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Van Houten held Rosemary LaBianca down while she was killed, then also stabbed her 14 times. They wrote in blood on the walls and also carved “WAR” into Leno LaBianca’s stomach. The gory double homicide was carried out one day after the killings of actress Sharon Tate and four others, acts of “Helter Skelter” that Manson had convinced his followers would start a race war. “I don’t let myself off the hook,” Van Houten told the parole board on Thursday, according to the AP. “I don’t find parts in any of this that makes me feel the slightest bit good about myself. ” It was the 21st time Van Houten, now 66, had come up for parole consideration since she was convicted of murder. She, Manson, and other followers were initially sentenced to death, then   to life in prison after the death penalty was temporarily abolished in California. Since her incarceration, Van Houten has earned college degrees and shown exemplary behavior, her attorney said. Tate’s sister, however, has argued that Van Houten should never be released. In an online petition, Debra Tate noted that two juries had agreed Van Houten should not be in free society. She was retried after an appeal and convicted of murder and conspiracy in 1978. “Ms. Van Houten should not be paroled and the [parole] board needs to know society cannot trust someone who committed such a heinous murder without showing any remorse for years,” Tate wrote.

2016-04-18,"President Barack Obama spoke by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin, but didn’t object to the   flyovers made by Russian warplanes against a U. S. warship April 11 and 12 in the Baltic Sea. [White House spokesman Josh Earnest confirms the president had spoken on the phone with Putin to discuss multiple issues involving national security. But Earnest indicated that Obama did not discuss the viral video of two Russian Sukhoi   bombers buzzing the United States Navy destroyer USS Donald Cook.  “That did not come up in the call between the two presidents,” Earnest said, when questioned by reporters. Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the incident last week, calling it “reckless” and “provocative” after it was widely reported. “People need to understand that this is serious business and the United States is not going to be intimidated on the high seas,” he said last week. “We are communicating to the Russians how dangerous this is and our hope is that this will never be repeated. ” But the Russians appeared proud of their actions, bragging of their piloting skills in the media. “Judging by the videos released by the U.

2016-04-19,"       It happened during the boarding process on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to JFK in the fall of 2009. I had long earlier learned that the key to a pleasant flight was to greet everyone as they walked onto the plane, so I stood in the front galley and said my hellos. Suddenly, a   white woman leaned uncomfortably close to me and whispered, “There is a man, four people behind me, in a green shirt, who is very suspicious. ” I whispered back: “Okay. What’s he doing?” “You’ll see,” she said,  . I thought two things: This woman is probably racist. And I need to take her seriously. As a former flight attendant for a major carrier, I wasn’t surprised to hear that a Southwest Airlines passenger reported University of California student Khairuldeen Makhzoomi as suspicious after he said “Inshallah” (“God willing”) during a phone call conducted in Arabic while boarding a flight at Los Angeles International Airport this month. Flight attendants are often made to play referee when hundreds of humans with wildly different life experiences are crammed into an aircraft cabin. It’s usually simple stuff, like asking a young woman who has never seen a Hasidic Jew if she can switch seats with her boyfriend so she’s not touching the devout man next to her. (She, of course, has the right to say no.) Or moving the man with the severe dog allergy as far away as possible from the blind woman’s service animal. Or asking the bachelor party to pipe down for the umpteenth time, because not everyone is going to Las Vegas to get drunk. But sometimes you’re asked to be someone’s accomplice  —   in their racism, their homophobia, their cruel joke about the larger person seated next to them or their demand that the mother in front of them drug her children to shut them up. For professionals who are supposed to be polite, it can get awkward. The expression “Takes all kinds!” becomes your best friend.   [Airline apologizes after kicking woman off flight for having cancer]   This past week, Southwest released a statement saying that the passenger who reported Makhzoomi also spoke Arabic and was alarmed by the content of his conversation, not the language itself. Makhzoomi says he was telling his uncle in Baghdad about attending a speech by U. N. Secretary General Ban   and made a passing reference to the Islamic State. The airport police agency says Makhzoomi made no threats and broke no laws. It is not illegal to mention the existence of the Islamic State on an aircraft. But to me, the most shocking thing about the whole story is that, according to Makhzoomi, from the time the other passenger reported him to the time he was asked to leave the plane, he had no interaction with the flight attendants. Flight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior with videos, checklists, regular exams and drills. (And drills and drills and drills.) This infuses you with an automatic, paranoid vigilance that follows you forever and insists that you take all threats seriously, since the cost of being wrong is too high. But nowhere did our training recommend that we accept a passenger’s assessment of a situation, and nowhere did it teach that speaking Arabic is cause for suspicion. It’s unlikely that any airlines do. I contacted all of the major U. S. airlines this past week to ask about training procedures. United Airlines, Frontier Airlines and Southwest declined to reveal any details. A spokesman for American Airlines said the company never trains crew members to perceive the Arabic language,   or   clothing or a Middle Eastern background as suspicious.    Khairuldeen Makhzoomi spoke Arabic on a Southwest plane, and a passenger reported him to the flight crew. Soon, he was being questioned by the FBI. (AP)   During that 2009 flight, after the woman alerted me to the “suspicious” passenger, I thanked her and told her I’d check it out. I watched the man closely as he stepped onto the plane, looking for signs of a terrorist. Was he jittery? Nope. Was he sweating? A little bit, but we were in South Florida; I was sweating, too. Was he wearing unseasonable clothing, like a big coat in the summertime? No. In fact, his Green Bay Packers jersey perfectly fit the season  —   football season. Did he have trouble following a normal conversation? “Hi, how’re you doing today?” I asked. “Fine,” he said, nodding casually. “Going home?” I asked. “Nope, wedding,” he said. All right, no problems there. A few minutes later, after he reached his seat, I walked down the aisle to assess the situation again, the woman who flagged him tracking me with her eyes. Did he hold on tightly to a piece of luggage? No, his   was in the overhead bin. Did he sit stiffly? Nope, he was slouched in his seat, headphones on, already watching the game on the   TV. Not exactly the actions of a person who believes he’s about to die. In fact, the only thing he appeared to have in common with the   hijackers was that he was brown. He could have been Punjabi or Puerto Rican; I have no idea. He could have been a Catholic, or a Sikh, or one of the many hundreds of millions of Muslims who have nothing to do with terrorism. I let it go and had no further discussion with the man or the woman, other than to serve them drinks and bid them well when they disembarked. I hope, and I think it’s likely, that the man never noticed what was happening. In other cases, airlines have ended up on the losing ends of lawsuits. In 2006, Iraqi immigrant Raed Jarrar wasforced to change his   which said “We will not be silent” in English and Arabic, before boarding a JetBlue Airways flight. JetBlue and the Transportation Security Administration eventually paid him $240, 000 to settle a lawsuit. In another 2006 incident, six imams were removed from a US Airways flight after they prayed in the departure lounge at  . Paul International Airport; the airline and the imams eventually settled out of court.   [Stop asking me to condemn terrorism just because I’m Muslim]   Southwest, despite this incident, has a   reputation for friendly customer service. I know Southwest flight attendants, and even in the relative privacy of their Facebook feeds, they talk about genuinely loving their passengers and the work they do to keep them safe and comfortable. But that comfort must include filtering out passengers’ biases and flight attendants’ own. Heather Poole, a flight attendant and the author of “Cruising Attitude,” puts it this way: “Flight attendants don’t live in a bubble. We don’t get to pick and choose who we associate with. We rub elbows with the world. . . . Has a passenger ever made me nervous? Yes. Did we kick that passenger off? No. I just kept on eye on them. Did anything happen during the flight? No. ” I grew up in a wealthy, mostly white, mostly Mormon town out West. Respecting God’s will was a frequent topic of conversation among my friends. And, like lots of future pilots and flight attendants, my favorite toy was the globe. I’d spin and spin it, dreaming of all the different, “exotic” places I’d go. Becoming a flight attendant made my dreams come true. That included travel to   countries, where the frequent incantation of “God willing” was far from exotic  —   it reminded me of home. When passengers report an issue, it’s impossible to know what their life experiences are. That’s why it’s so important to make assessments based on training. In this case, being polite and being vigilant should have called for the same thing: a conversation. Anyone who makes a snap judgment from the cocoon of the galley has no business being a flight attendant."
2016-04-20," Did Saudi Arabia, an American ally but a country that supports extremists, have a hand in the attacks of September 11, 2001?    When Americans talk about this question, they will often mention a section of a   2002 congressional report, which has achieved such infamy that it is described only as ”the 28 pages.” Those pages are in the news again now, resurfacing   debate in the US over Saudi Arabia and  . Here is what we know about that document and about the question of Saudi involvement in  . Though subsequent US government investigations concluded there is no proof of official Saudi support for the attacks, American doubts persist, showing that this controversy is perhaps not exclusively about   but could also draw on deeper, unresolved American doubts about the   alliance and about why we responded to the attacks as we did.    What are the 28 pages? In 2002, shortly after a Joint Congressional Inquiry into the   attacks concluded its report, the Bush administration ordered that the inquiry permanently seal a   section that investigated possible Saudi government links to the attack. It has remained sealed ever since.    Some members of Congress who have read the report, but are barred from revealing its contents, describe it as potentially damning. An unnamed member of Congress told the New Yorker, ”The real question is whether it was sanctioned at the   level or beneath that, and whether these leads were followed through.” ”The 28 pages primarily relate to who financed   and they point a very strong finger at Saudi Arabia as being the principal financier,” former Sen. Bob Graham, who is leading the charge to release the document, said in February.    Other officials, though, say the findings are speculative and inconclusive and have been rebuked by subsequent investigations. They warn that their release would spread unfounded conspiracy theories and cause unwarranted damage to the   alliance, which has grown increasingly fragile in recent years. The controversy over the 28 pages has resurfaced over and over in the years since, including, again, this week. The families of   victims have expressed a desire to sue the Saudi government over the attacks, but such suits are typically barred by US law. Congress is now considering legislation that would allow their suit to go forward.    President Obama, traveling to Saudi Arabia this week, is expected to address concerns there that the document could be released. His administration is urging Congress to drop the bill, and Saudi officials have threatened, should the law pass, to sell off $750 billion in   assets. What do we know about Saudi Arabia and  ? Saudi Arabia has a long and tangled history with jihadist movements. In the 1980s, during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the Saudi government (along with the US) aggressively funded Arab volunteers who fought against the Soviets. The Saudis especially favored religious extremists, including a wealthy Saudi citizen named Osama bin Laden, who led a group of fanatical Arab fighters in Afghanistan that later became  . By the 1990s, though, the Saudi government and bin Laden had become enemies. Their disagreements were many but culminated in the royal family inviting the United States to station troops in Saudi Arabia to defend against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, which had invaded neighboring Kuwait. But Saudi Arabia has long played a double game with extremists, including in the 1990s. It revoked bin Laden’s citizenship and deported him, but was one of only three countries to officially recognize the Taliban, an extremist group that had seized Afghanistan and officially sheltered bin Laden and  . Saudi Arabia’s record of backing jihadists and of a shadowy,    strategy has raised understandable suspicions about the country’s possible links to    —   enough that the US government has investigated this question at least twice since the Joint Congressional Inquiry.    Those reports, which have been made at least their final assessments public, found no evidence that the Saudi government supported the   attacks or attackers.            After the Joint Congressional Inquiry, the   Commission formed to independently investigate the attacks. Their investigators followed up the same details and questions on possible Saudi involvement, and even hired some of the same staffers who had worked on the Joint Congressional Inquiry. But the   Commission ultimately dismissed the earlier findings on Saudi Arabia as unsubstantiated. ”Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of Al Qaeda funding, but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization,” the report concluded. This past June, the CIA’s Office of the Inspector General finally released the findings of its own internal investigation, concluded in 2005, into intelligence failures leading up to the   attacks. The final section of the report, titled ”Issues related to Saudi Arabia,” addressed the question of possible Saudi involvement. That section is entirely redacted, save for three brief paragraphs, which say the investigation was inconclusive but found ”no evidence that the Saudi government knowingly and willingly supported the   terrorists.” These conclusions would seem to fit with what we know about the Saudi government.    For instance, while Saudi Arabia has a history of supporting jihadist movements, it uses them as military tools to achieve narrow political ends: fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, fighting Bashar   in Syria. Saudi leaders do not appear to support jihadists out of ideological fealty. Indeed, Saudi royals are notorious for spending much of their time living lavishly in the West. Jihadists will take Saudi money but often consider the royal family apostates and Western puppets  —   and will often attack the Saudi government itself. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the US have been close allies for decades, and for reasons beyond just oil. They shared enemies in the Soviet Union, Saddam’s Iraq, and revolutionary Iran. Saudi and US officials had spent two generations working closely together and often becoming personally friendly. Looking at this history, it is difficult to imagine a reason the Saudi government would work clandestinely with its jihadist enemies to strike the US, its most important ally and benefactor. But there is another theory, one hinted at in the   investigations, of a different kind of Saudi involvement: that of rogue Saudi officials acting against the wishes and interests of their government. What is the rogue Saudi official theory? Both the   Commission report and the CIA Inspector General report hint at  —   but do not fully substantiate  —   another possibility: Could rogue Saudi officials, acting without sanction from their government, have funneled state resources to aid the attackers?    The   Commission report states, ”This conclusion does not exclude the likelihood that charities with significant Saudi government sponsorship diverted funds to al Qaeda.” The CIA Inspector General report is more candid:  Individuals in both of the Near East Division (NE) and the Counterterrorist Center (CTC) [redacted] told the Team they had not seen any reliable reporting confirming Saudi Government involvement with and financial support for terrorism prior to   although a few also speculated that dissident sympathizers within the government may have aided  ’ida. A January 1999 Directorate of Intelligence (DI)  of Transnational Issues Intelligence Report on Bin Ladin’s finances indicated that ”limited” reporting suggested that ”a few Saudi Government officials” may support Usama Bin Ladin (UBL) but added that the reporting was ”too sparse to determine with any accuracy” such support.  It is worth reiterating that this theory has never been confirmed. But, as commonly told, it begins with Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Saudi Arabia, fearing it could be next, invited the US military to station thousands of troops in the kingdom. The country’s powerful and ultraconservative clerical establishment was outraged, seeing this as a humiliation and a desecration of Muslim holy land, and openly hinted it might support a violent uprising. The Saudi royal family responded as they had to other such crises: by   and appeasing the clerical establishment. They shut down some nascent liberalizing reforms that had angered ultraconservative clerics, for example. And they established a new government agency, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, designed to appease Saudi ultraconservatives, some of whom were recruited to the agency itself and given wide latitude.    Islamic Affairs ostensibly supported Islamic charities as a humanitarian and   mission. But, owing to the ideological leanings of the ministry’s officers, it also funded Islamist extremism and jihadism throughout the Muslim world. The ministry, closely tied to the Saudi clerical establishment that has never really been under the government’s control, operated with an unusual degree of autonomy. The government tolerated this; better that ultraconservatives cause trouble abroad than at home. Could some of the officials in that ministry, acting independently, have quietly deployed their resources in support of the   hijackers? In recent years, a handful of inconclusive but highly disturbing details have come out that suggest possible links between the Ministry of Islamic Affairs and the hijackers. For example, a Saudi living in the US who had ties to the Islamic Affairs Ministry, and who was salaried by a Saudi aviation company for whom he never actually did any work, facilitated and paid for an apartment for two of the   hijackers. His   contact in Islamic Affairs, Fahad   was expelled from the US in 2002 over suspected ties to terrorists. Such details, along with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs’ unusual autonomy and its links to an ultraconservative clerical establishment that could be at times more sympathetic to jihadists than to their own government, have long fed speculation that rogue officials in the ministry could have played a role.    Again, while this theory has never been confirmed, it is difficult to rule out completely, both because US investigators have raised it and because this theory would comport with what we know about the Saudi government and the Saudi clerical establishment. If some version of this theory made it into the   ”28 pages,” then that could at least hypothetically explain the confusion over what the report does and does not show. It is easy to imagine, for example, that the report’s authors initially treated evidence for this theory as possibly implicating the Saudi government itself but, when those investigators looked at the same question in greater depth for the   Commission report, decided it did not. That is speculation, but the point is that, now 15 years after   we have the distance to conclude that there is strong reason to doubt that the Saudi government would have supported the attacks, but at least moderate cause for wondering if rogue officials with Islamic Affairs might have been involved. In 2002, when the ”28 pages” were written, we did not have that distance. So why does this debate keep coming back, time and again? What is it about those 28 pages, and about questions of Saudi involvement, that seems to so nag at Americans? Why do the 28 pages keep coming up? The recurring debates over the 28 pages are a reminder of why so many Americans still wonder, nearly 15 years later, whether our closest Arab ally might have shared responsibility for the worst ever terror attack on US soil. Because the document is still sealed and cannot be independently examined, but has been the subject of so much speculation, it has become something of a Rorschach test for how one considers the question of possible Saudi involvement in  . And that question is often about more than just  .    The 28 pages can be a way to debate the American alliance with Saudi Arabia itself. If the case against releasing the document is that it would harm   ties, then your view naturally turns on whether you see that alliance as worth protecting. Demanding the release of the documents can be a way of expressing skepticism of the Saudis and of the   alliance. In some ways, then, this is as much a controversy over   as it is over longstanding, and recently growing, American discomfort with the Saudi alliance, which at times appears counter to both US values and interests. Since the Arab Spring, that alliance has appeared increasingly strained, both because the two countries have developed conflicting goals for the region and because it is uncomfortable for the US to seek Mideast democracy while also supporting a theocratic absolute monarchy. The monarchy, Americans have grown keenly aware, makes a practice of supporting jihadists, which naturally increases the threat to the United States. (The jihadists also threatened, and have attacked, Saudi Arabia itself.) When Americans hear denials that Saudi Arabia supported the particular jihadists who launched the   attacks, then, it conflicts with their understanding of reality and can feel untrue. The controversy also thrives on unresolved emotions over the legacy of  . There remains, still years after the attacks, distrust of an official narrative that initially blamed Saddam Hussein; a sense that we went after the wrong enemy by invading Iraq; and skepticism about why the US still allies itself with a Saudi government known for promoting extremists.    These are difficult issues that the United States has never fully confronted, in part because it would require asking hard questions about the utility of an Iraq war for which thousands of Americans gave their lives. While these issues do not necessarily suggest that Saudi Arabia had a hand in   it is easy to see how, to many Americans, that could end up feeling true. The 28 pages, regardless of what they actually show, are way of answering the unanswered questions and resolving the unresolved emotions that Americans have never quite collectively processed. The existence of those secret 28 pages, and the Saudi and White House effort to keep them secret, seem to hint at confirmation of things many Americans suspect: that we attacked the wrong enemy after   that our Saudi allies are not allies at all, and that American policy toward the Middle East is disastrously shortsighted and  . Asking about the 28 pages is a way of conveying these beliefs. Those things can indeed be true  —   and there is a case to be made that they are  —   without it being the case that Saudi Arabia somehow participated in the   terror attacks. "
2016-04-21,"Editor’s note: This week, to mark the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s death, we will be running a series of stories examining the links between food and the Bard. ”Life . .. consists of eating and drinking,” quips Twelfth Night’s   Sir Andrew Aguecheek. It seems that Shakespeare’s audiences felt the same. Between 1988 and 1990, when archaeologists excavated The Rose and The Globe theaters (where Shakespeare’s plays were performed) they were able to learn as much about the audiences as the playhouses themselves. There were no dress circle lounges nor mezzanine bars 400 years ago. As the characters in plays like The Taming of the Shrew, Macbeth and As You Like It feasted on stage, down in the yard and up in the galleries, the audience noshed on cold nibbles and   street food. Archaeologist Julian Bowsher at the Museum of London Archaeology has found evidence of grapes, figs, blackberries, raspberries and plums, as well as small animal bones that suggest playgoers ”could certainly have eaten a cold chicken” while laughing at one of Shakespeare’s many capon jokes (see Love’s Labour’s Lost, Much Ado About Nothing, and Two Gentlemen of Verona). The early 17th century play Wit Without Money, says, Bowsher, also complains of young apprentices who cracked nuts throughout a performance  —   Jacobean versions of those annoyingly loud popcorn munchers sitting behind you at the Cineplex.  But the largest haul from the excavation underneath the theaters was oyster shells. Shakespeare mentions the popular shellfish in at least six plays. Benedict fears being made an oyster by love in Much Ado, and then there’s Pistol’s braggadocio in Merry Wives: ”Why, then the world’s mine oyster. Which I with sword will open.” Such moments likely provided a ripe opportunity for actors to break the fourth wall and have a bit of fun with the audience. Where did theatergoers get their snacks? They possibly bought them from vendors they passed on their way to the performance. Often a theater also benefited from a taphouse next door, ”where you could buy food and drink for the show,” says Bowsher. These establishments were just the sort of convivial drinking holes that Measure for Measure’s Froth (who’s named for the head on ale) jokes he never enters of his own accord but instead ”is drawn in.” John Hemminges, one of the actors in the Lord Chamberlain’s Men (the company for which Shakespeare wrote) owned a tap house next to the Globe. ”There was also quite clearly a mechanism for [taphouse] employees to come and sell things in the play yard,” says Bowsher. ”We know that in one case there was a water seller.” And Paul Hentzner  —   a German lawyer who traveled through England during the Elizabethan era  —   wrote that while visiting London in 1598, he saw wine and ale for sale, as well. But plays were not put on in theaters alone. Inns were often called to serve as performance spaces. Some, like the Boar’s Head in Whitechapel and the Red Bull in Clerkenwell, were turned into permanent playhouses during Shakespeare’s time. And they ”probably continued the preparation and serving of food and drink” alongside performances since they already had the facilities, Bowsher says. ”We’ve uncovered Shakespeare’s working world,” he says, ”the environment he was playing and acting and writing for.” And all the evidence they’ve found points to the audience ”having a boisterous time. .. busy eating and drinking and enjoying the show.” Anne Bramley wrote on food in early modern literature during her a Ph. D. at the University of Chicago and taught Shakespeare at Duke University. She is the author of Eat Feed Autumn Winter."
2016-04-22,"Suicide rates in the United States have soared to a   high, with the most striking surge among   women and white people, according to federal data released Friday. The total number of suicides rose from 29, 199 in 1999 to 42, 773 in 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Medical professionals said the numbers are alarming. “The rate is ridiculously high. It’s a big issue,” said Dr. Charles Nemeroff, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Miami. “Of the top 10 causes of death  —   including cancer, strokes, heart disease  —   everything else went down but suicide went up,” he said. “It’s particularly striking among women, because they have traditionally had much lower suicide rates. ” For women between the ages of 45 and 64, the suicide rate jumped 63 percent in the   period. It rose 43 percent for men in the same age group, according to the data. Overall,   white people  —   a group that represents just 18 percent of America  —   accounted for a striking 33 percent of suicides. Of the nearly 43, 000 people who killed themselves in 2014, 14, 000 were   whites. That’s twice the combined rate for blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska Natives. “The findings in this report are extremely concerning,” said Nadine Kaslow, an Emory University researcher and past president of the American Psychological Association. The trend may be tied to unemployment, war and budget cuts for   treatments. Economic stress after   and during the   recession may also have played a role in the high rates. “Unemployment or the sudden loss of a job plays a huge role,” Nemeroff said. “And in that time period, you’ve got factors like terrorism and war. ” At the same time, there was less preventative treatment available to people suffering from   problems than in previous decades. “In the 1990s and 1980s, there were early intervention and education programs available  —   but there’s no funding for them now,” Nemeroff said. “It’s a combination of economic stress and decreased services. ” The overall suicide rate reached 13 people out of every 100, 000  —   the highest rate since 1986. Poisoning was the top way women chose to kill themselves, while men most often used firearms. The suicide rate decreased in only two demographic groups: black males and people over age 75."
2016-04-23," Sgt. Tu Nguyen of the police department’s child abuse unit told the San Diego Tribune that the incident happened in the city’s Mira Mesa neighborhood. According to Nguyen, the family was watching television in bed together with the American Staffordshire   Dane mix when the mother coughed, startling the dog. The dog reacted by mauling the newborn baby, before the parents were able to pull the animal off the child. They rushed the infant to hospital, where he was declared dead. San Diego county animal services have since impounded the    male dog, which will be held in quarantine for 10 days pending test results for rabies. The family’s names have not been released.  "
2016-04-24," Americans on Sunday will have collectively worked long enough in 2016 to pay for the county’s total tax bill for the year. While the   “Tax Freedom Day” is largely an obscure, historical footnote, lawmakers, taxpayers, fiscal conservatives and others watch each year to see how many days Americans must work annually to cover the bill, which pays for such expenditure as defense spending, Social Security, education, emergency operations and national security. Taxpayers needed 114 days in 2016 to cover the tax bill, one day less than last year. However, Tax Freedom Day would fall on May 10 if annual federal borrowing, which represents future taxes owed, was included. The nonprofit Tax Foundation, which does the calculations, found Americans this year will pay $3. 3 trillion in federal taxes and $1. 6 trillion in state and local taxes, for a total bill of almost $5 trillion, or 31 percent of the nation’s income, The foundation points out that Americans in 2016 will collectively spend more on taxes than they will on food, clothing and housing combined. “That still won’t be enough to satisfy D. C.’s spending addiction,” Andy Koenig, a policy adviser at Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a recent   for the   newspaper in Louisville, Ky. “Washington will once again spend more than it brings in this year, adding $534 billion to the already massive federal debt. ” Koenig also argued the country’s tax code “is a mess” and pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office, the federal government’s fiscal watchdog, estimated last month that the federal deficits will grow every year for the foreseeable future. To be sure, the federal tax code is a major issue in the 2016 presidential race, as it has been in recent election cycles. GOP   and billionaire Donald Trump wants to establish four tax brackets    zero, 10, 20 and 25 percent  —   with the top rate applying to   with income above $150, 000 and joint filers with income exceeding $300, 000. Democratic   Hillary Clinton wants to add a   surtax on income above $5 million. GOP candidates Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich have also laid out plans, according to the foundation. But perhaps none of the candidates has been as passionate about the issue as Democratic candidate Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose insurgent campaign has taken aim at ending income inequality. “We need a progressive tax system in this country that is based on the ability to pay,” Sanders says. “If we are serious about reforming the tax code and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to demand that the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations pay their fair share in taxes. ” Sanders wants to create four new brackets    37, 43, 48, and 52 percent    with the top rate applying to taxable income over $10 million, according to the foundation. Sanders says he also wants to close “loopholes that benefit the wealthy and well connected,” which includes establishing a tax on Wall Street speculators. The Tax Freedom Day calculations were purportedly done by a Florida businessman from 1948 until 1971, when the foundation took over and also started doing annual calculations dating back to 1900. This year, Americans will work the longest to pay federal, state, and local individual income taxes (46 days). Payroll taxes will take 26 days to pay, followed by sales and excise taxes (15 days) corporate income taxes (nine days) and property taxes (11 days). The remaining seven days are spent paying estate and inheritance taxes, customs duties, and other taxes, the foundation reports.    "

Send us a screenshot  —   email tech@npr. org —   and tell us how we can reach you. Uber is waiting for a federal judge to approve a major legal settlement, reached on two cases brought in California and Massachusetts. It would require the   company to pay up to $100 million to drivers and, in exchange, continue to treat the drivers as independent contractors, not employees. As contractors, drivers will keep getting paid for hours worked with no benefits. We’ve heard mixed reviews from drivers in California. But here’s what we want to know: How much do Uber drivers make, really? When Uber wants to fill a city with drivers  —   say for the Super Bowl or New Year’s Eve  —   the company advertises $35 (!) an hour. And in some very limited circumstances, the company even guarantees that rate. For the most part, drivers are not making $35 an hour. Are they making minimum wage? There aren’t reliable numbers or surveys that can help us analyze driver wages. Uber’s released data on driver sentiment  —   for instance, how many people like being their own boss  —   but not on income and expenses. Where the information does exist is right on the drivers’ app. Uber drivers get a really    weekly breakdown: how many hours they worked, how much they took home for it.

2016-04-27,"The NYPD arrested 120 suspected gang members in the biggest   in New York City’s history, CBS New York reports, for crimes such as murder, robbery, drug trafficking, and more. [Federal authorities from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Agency also took part in the raids as more than 1, 000 law enforcement officers in helicopters and armored trucks nabbed suspects from the “2Fly YGz” and the “Big Money Bosses” gangs accused of “terrorizing residents” for years with their violent lawlessness. Sources tell the New York Daily News that the suspects may be responsible for seven murders, including the death of a    woman killed by a stray bullet.  The massive takedown in the Bronx comes as Republicans debate a sentencing reduction and early release bill for convicted criminals and the Obama administration celebrates “National Reentry Week” for convicted criminals, many of whom are violent repeat offenders. Many of the arrested Bronx suspects appear to be young adults. If convicted, they’re primed to become beneficiaries of the Obama administration’s   dollar efforts to ensure that as   they can receive more taxpayer dollars. Attorney General Loretta Lynch calls criminals under the age of 24 convicted of serious crimes “  youth” and is working to expunge or seal some criminal records so they suffer few if any ongoing consequences for destroying lives and Americans don’t know if they’re dealing with a dangerous criminal. Even if convicted of murder and other violent crimes, the felons can move to Virginia and enjoy voting rights, the ability to run for office and serve on juries, and work as a notary. Longtime Clinton ally Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe granted 206, 000 felons these rights just months before the presidential election  —   and that’s just a start. They can enjoy the same rights as their victims and lifelong,   citizens. Republicans pushing sentencing reductions in Congress, which conservative journalist David Horowitz criticizes as “jailbreak” legislation, are repeating the same lines as the Democrats about the myth of “mass incarceration” and the sudden need to help Democrats hasten the release of criminals to ply them with more taxpayer money and give them a   over  . They couch it in the language of togetherness  —   as president of the American Enterprise Institute Arthur Brooks said at the White House on Monday: “What better way to bring people together than to look at those at the periphery of our society and say, what can we do together to need them?” But Americans not safely isolated in gated, superrich neighborhoods like D. C. think tank leaders don’t appear to want “to need” those who have shown themselves to be a menace to society  —   as residents of Bronx neighborhoods can testify. As Speaker Paul Ryan rushes to ensure more gang members like those who held a poor New York neighborhood hostage are released back into the streets,   blacks and whites, along with swing voters, are growing more and more deeply worried about crime. The poll numbers are even more lopsided when broken down: While 46 percent of whites are greatly worried about crime, 68 percent of   are. The bipartisan scheme to break more convicts out of prison as crime soars isn’t likely to put their fears to rest."
2016-04-28,"When it comes to Donald Trump’s women problems, the   polling numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. The real estate mogul’s sexist rhetoric coupled with his clumsy posturing on policy issues that already hamstrung Republicans with female voters have exacerbated a gender gap that helped President Obama defeat Mitt Romney in 2012. It’s no secret that Trump    whose latest antagonization was his insistence Tuesday night that Hillary Clinton was relying on the “woman card”    is turning off women in huge numbers. But Trump is not just angering the women who were maybe leaning Democratic anyway. Current polling shows Trump is turning off the subset of women voters who are typically up for grabs in elections and who in other cycles have swung races towards Republicans. He is even alienating the type of dependable Republican female voters who turned out for Romney the last time around. To make matters worse for him, Trump’s deficit among women are blunting some of the vulnerabilities Clinton would be facing if pitted against a less controversial Republican.  The gender gap in a Trump v. Clinton   is different from the gender gap in previous elections, according to Margie Omero, a Democratic pollster and   of the podcast “The Pollsters. ” ”Sometimes when you look at overall what’s happening, people will say, ’Well women think this and men think this,’ and sometimes it’s because of party rather than because of gender,” Omero told TPM. ”When it comes to Trump it’s actually both. He’s got a gender problem even within his own party.” For decades, women have made up a majority of the electorate. Elections have featured a consistent gender gap where men lean Republican and women Democrat. Republicans can only be successful when their advantage among men is greater than their deficit among women.  Trump’s deficit among women is enormous and getting worse. Per Gallup’s tracking, 70 percent of women view him unfavorably, up from 58 percent last July. Trump’s problem looks even more dire when broken down by the subsets women that are typically in play or can depended on by Republicans.  Married women, who turned out for Mitt Romney over Obama by 53 percent to 46 percent, have an overwhelmingly negative view of Trump. Seventy percent of them view Trump unfavorably, according to Purple Slice online poll conducted by Purple Strategies for Bloomberg Politics and released earlier this month. Married women choose Clinton over Trump 48 percent to 36 percent. (The married female vote would be split    percent if Clinton was facing Cruz, according to the poll.) “There’s a   gap between where [Trump] is and where he needs to be just to match Romney, who lost,” Douglas Usher, a pollster for Purple Strategies, told TPM. An early April Democracy Corps poll conducted for the Women’s Voices Women Vote Action Fund found numbers not quite as ugly but still troubling for   Trump. He beat Clinton among married women, but by only 3 percentage points. Meanwhile, Clinton slaughtered him among unmarried women 73 percent to 21 percent. “Married women are supporting Trump by a slight margin and unmarried women are giving Hillary Clinton a   advantage. That’s huge,” said Page Gardner, president of the Women’s Voices Women Vote Action Fund. While Trump’s problems with minorities voters are   he could lose the advantage Republican had with white females in 2012. Despite a   gender gap overall, Romney was still able to win among white women, 56 percent to Obama 42 percent. (Obama meanwhile  won 96 percent of black women and 76 of  Hispanic women). According to a Washington Post poll from this month, 66 percent of white women view Trump unfavorably, and 55 percent of them very unfavorably. “Overall, in the general election, he is not where he needs be among white women,” Usher said. On top of that, female voters’ resistance to Trump is helping Clinton where she might have otherwise been vulnerable. For instance, she has a 3 percent favorability deficit among women, according to Gallup, which might be concerning if she wasn’t likely running against Trump, who is facing a   unfavorabilty gap among women. That easily offsets the   favorability deficit Clinton faces with male voters, who also view Trump unfavorably by a   spread. Trump’s women issues are also driving up Clinton numbers among young people, who have been skeptical of Clinton in her primary race against Sanders. For instance, in a generic   young women support a Democrat over a Republican by a   margin, according to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll of   to    likely voters released this week. But once young voters are asked to chose between Trump and Clinton, the spread among young women increases to 42 points. (For comparison, the advantage Democrats have among young men increases by only half that, from 18 points in a generic matchup to 22 points in a Clinton v. Trump contest). “He’s well behind even where [2008 GOP nominee John] McCain was among younger voters and younger women in particular,” Usher said, referring to the Harvard Institute of Politics Poll, One other place Trump’s   rhetoric is costing him is with the very demographic that supposedly makes up his base of support: the white working class. He is still winning among white working class female voters, but by far slimmer margins than Republicans in the past. The Democracy Corps poll showed that, while Clinton is doing 5 points worse than Obama in 2012 among white   educated men, Trump’s support among their female counterparts is four percentage points less than what Romney earned. “As Hillary Clinton loses support among white   men, that’s made up by her gaining support from white   women,” Gardner said.

2016-04-29,"       ALTER EGOS: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the Twilight Struggle Over American Power By Mark Landler Random House. 406 pp. $28 There is something about the relationship between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that fascinates Washington journalists  —   and then stymies them. In 2009, we learned that NBC’s Chuck Todd was writing a book about Obama and Clinton, a “nuanced analytical narrative” of their political relationship, according to Todd’s agent. By the time “The Stranger” came out in 2014, though, it had devolved into a daily rundown of Obama White House coverage; the portions focusing on the president and secretary of state, however tantalizing, were a small part of the story. Now Mark Landler of the New York Times offers “Alter Egos,” promising the inside account of Obama and Clinton, “protagonists in a great debate over American power . . . archrivals who became partners for a time, trailblazers who shared a common sense of their historic destiny but different instincts about how to project power. ” The result is an outstanding book on U. S. foreign policy over the past seven years, a work that is granular when it must be and overarching when it can, revealing how foreign relations are conducted and deliberated, and packed with     anecdotes.    (Random House)  What it does not provide, however, is a particularly surprising look at the relationship between the two principals or a clear sense of sharply contrasting foreign policy doctrines. Although Landler plays up the differences  —   “Clinton and Obama have come to embody competing visions of America’s role in the world”  —   there is no real clash of worldviews here. As the author admits early on, “It must be said, [they] agreed more than they disagreed. ” Where they diverge, their differences are more of style than of substance, of instinct than of principle. But style and instinct matter, and in Landler’s hands, they make a worthwhile tale. There are many   books dealing with individual aspects of U. S. foreign policy in recent years, but for a single work encompassing the Obama administration’s engagement with the world, it is hard to imagine one better. From the Arab Spring to the resurgence of Russia to the Iran nuclear deal, Landler reveals a president obsessed with making history, and a secretary of state weighing every move in light of her personal advancement. Really, “Alter Egos” could just be called “Egos. ”   is a bloodsport in Washington, as the book makes clear. Back in the halcyon,   days, when the U. S. intervention in Libya seemed successful, Clinton’s team wanted to make sure everyone knew that it was all hers. Top aide Jake Sullivan put together a list of items showcasing Clinton’s “   of this country’s Libya policy from start to finish” and urged the secretary to seize the moment with an   articulating “something definitive  —   almost like the Clinton Doctrine. ” Obama was more circumspect about the intervention. When   House aide Samantha Power, author of the Pulitzer   “A Problem From Hell,” spoke up in the Situation Room about America’s moral responsibility to protect Libyan civilians, Obama snapped back: “This isn’t an opportunity for you to write a new chapter of your book. ” The administration’s “pivot to Asia,” which Landler describes as a “healthy collaboration” between Obama and Clinton, also produced a “bitter    between those who tried to claim authorship. ” It was almost comical, with Obama national security adviser Tom Donilon and Clinton both racing to produce thinky journal articles that would plant flags in the administration’s renewed focus on U. S. leadership in Asia. Donilon was writing an essay for Foreign Affairs but took too long to complete it. (“It became a joke because every month there’d be meetings about the Foreign Affairs article,” an aide told Landler.) Meanwhile, Clinton was drafting a piece for Foreign Policy on the same subject, even while some White House officials encouraged her to shift to a snoozier topic, like multilateralism. Clinton won, publishing “America’s Pacific Century” on Oct. 11, 2011, boasting of her multiple trips to Asia. “It might as well have said, ‘Clinton’s Pacific Century,’ ” Landler writes. Certainly, Clinton was deeply involved in key aspects of the pivot, particularly in rebuilding trust with Chinese officials. Jim Steinberg, her deputy at the State Department, coined the phrase “strategic reassurance” to describe how Washington should manage ties with the emerging Asian power. (A rule of   : Add “strategic” to any concept, and it’ll sound weightier.) [Why America is terrible at making the world a better place] But when Clinton shifted from secretary of state to presidential candidate, she disavowed a major element of the pivot: the   trade deal known as the   Partnership. Though she supported it as secretary, her “political calculations during a Democratic primary were clear,” Landler notes. The move, appeasing key Democratic interest groups, stung her former administration colleagues. Such political calculations are a recurring theme for Landler, and they’re evident from the moment Clinton brought much of HillaryLand with her to Foggy Bottom. “Never before had the nation’s seat of diplomacy been so unabashedly political, with a constellation of   special envoys and advisers, some of whom knew next to nothing about diplomacy,” Landler writes. “In some ways, she never stopped behaving like a candidate. ” Political instincts guided Clinton away from issues she considered unwinnable, such as the   peace process, with the new secretary of state outright refusing an early trip to the region that   House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel urged her to take. They also served her well, as when she reached out to Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell to get   for her efforts to reestablish ties with Burma. “This was the kind of courtesy call that Barack Obama almost never made on Capitol Hill,” Landler emphasizes. And they compelled her to write lengthy    memos to the president as she exited the State Department, causing plenty of   at the White House. “We didn’t need a memo to know Putin is an a —  hole,” one Obama aide told Landler. Of course, Clinton’s political expediency reflected bureaucratic realities. The president liked running foreign policy out of the West Wing, Landler explains, and “Clinton had trouble penetrating Obama’s clannish inner circle. ” That inner circle was devoted to finding symbolic,   opportunities for the boss. Ben Rhodes, Obama’s foreign policy whisperer, regarded outreach to closed societies such as Cuba as “exactly what a   president like Obama should be doing,” Landler writes, and threw himself into secret negotiations with Havana. Obama saw the Iran nuclear agreement as a     achievement and pursued it accordingly. And he fretted that historians would remember him for the wrong thing. “I don’t want to be just remembered as the drone president,” he said to a top adviser in 2012. [The liberal war over the Obama legacy has already begun] In Landler’s telling, Obama is often at war with himself. “What I want is for the kids on the street to win and for the Google guy to become president,” Obama told aides, referring to the 2011 uprising in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and the leadership of Google executive Wael Ghonim. “What I think is that this is going to be long and hard. ” Problem is, we elect presidents to reconcile their wishes and their thoughts. “Alter Egos” offers plenty of memorable moments in the daily minutiae of foreign policy. It’s hard to forget Obama and Clinton barging past a security guard at a Copenhagen climate summit, into a room where Chinese, Indian, Brazilian and South African officials were dealing behind Washington’s back (“Mr. Prime Minister, are you ready to see me now?” Obama asked China’s Wen Jiabao). Or the evening Clinton tossed back pisco sours while negotiating with Chinese diplomat Zhang Yesui in a bar in Lima, Peru. Or the moment, during a marathon telephone session with Benjamin Netanyahu, “a frustrated Clinton began silently banging the phone on her forehead. ” Or when, after legendary diplomat Richard Holbrooke died from a torn aorta during stressful turf wars with the White House, Obama complained, “I’m sick of people writing about how I killed Richard Holbrooke. ” The tensions between Landler’s two protagonists often flowed from two staffs that still felt the sting of the bruising 2008 Democratic primary contest. But now it is Clinton who is campaigning for president, and Obama knows that his legacy hinges in part on her success. “Her campaign is Obama’s as well,” Landler concludes. History seems determined to keep Obama and Clinton as both team and rivals.

2016-04-30,"Former Assemblyman and current congressional candidate Tim Donnelly believes Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom’s gun control ballot initiative will serve to drive GOP voters to the voting booth, thereby providing a boon for GOP candidates. [Donnelly explained his theory by pointing to the 1982 gubernatorial election, an election in which “a strong turnout of voters opposed to a   measure   …     helped Republican George Deukmejian defeat Democrat Tom Bradley. ”  According to The Sacramento Bee, Donnelly believes the gains possible for the GOP are so great that Newsom’s      approach will end up as “a warning to the left. ” Newsom is seeking to outlaw all ammunition magazines in California that exceed the   limit Elliot Rodger used in his May 2014 Santa Barbara attack. Moreover, Newsom’s initiative also seeks to implement background checks for all   ammunition purchasers. Donnelly said he believes Californians are waking up to the fact that     is an empty promise. The Santa Barbara attack and more recent San Bernardino attacks occurred in spite of myriad gun controls, not for lack of them. Donnelly said: I am not going to call it   legislation. What it is is   legislation because, essentially, people have figured out that the government can’t and won’t protect us. So the only way we could do that is protect ourselves. That means we have to have the ability to keep and bear arms. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

2016-05-02,"     The five women crowded together around the kitchen table in New Jersey, their eyes fixed on a laptop screen. It was 7 a. m. and none of them had slept well the night before; they were too anxious and excited for this moment. Jess Katz logged into Skype as her mother and three sisters watched. A face flickered into view: their cousin, the son of a   uncle, the family they thought they had lost forever in the Holocaust. On the other side of the screen, on the other side of the world, Evgeny Belzhitsky sat with his daughter, his granddaughter and a translator in his home on Sakhalin Island, Russia. The eight family members smiled at each other, speechless. Then, Katz recalls, they all started to cry. “What do you say to someone you’ve been searching for your whole life?” Katz says. More than 70 years had passed since Katz’s grandfather, Abram Belz, first tried to find his younger brother, Chaim. Abram last saw Chaim in 1939, the year their family was relocated along with thousands of other Polish Jews to the Piotrków Trybunalski ghetto at the start of World War II. The brothers died without seeing each other again, but on April 20 their families had been joyfully reunited.   [These researchers used Holocaust survivors’ memories to track how our brains process gratitude]   The young men were separated soon after the family was forced into the ghetto following the Nazi invasion of Poland.  Abram’s mother had begged her two sons to escape and save themselves, Katz says. “My grandfather, because he was the oldest son, felt an obligation to stay,” she says. “But it was important to their mom that Chaim try to escape. ” With his mother’s help, Chaim slipped through a gap in the ghetto wall and fled across the border to the Soviet Union. The family knew he made it there, Katz says, because he sent letters and packages to his family. But then the letters and packages stopped coming. Abram described what happened next in a 1990 testimonial for Steven Spielberg’s USC Shoah Foundation project: Less than a year after we moved into the ghetto, my grandfather dropped dead in the house. Two weeks later, my    sister died of tuberculosis. My uncle who was 26 years old was shot, his wife and baby were sent to Treblinka where they were gassed to death by the Nazis. The rest of my family was exterminated. My parents were sent to Treblinka and were killed in the gas chambers.   [Watch: The Holocaust’s last voices]   Of more than 60 relatives, Abram and one of his cousins were the lone survivors of the concentration camps. Abram was liberated from the   concentration camp in 1945, and eventually resettled in Brooklyn, NY. He never stopped looking for Chaim. When Abram moved to the U. S. after the war, he wrote to the Polish government and sought the help of nonprofits that worked to connect survivors to their families. In the 1980’s, his daughter  —   Katz’s mother, Michelle Belz Katz  —   penned letters to the Red Cross, Yad Vashem (Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Center) and Russian and Polish officials, to no avail.    The Katz family’s records of their search for Chaim. (Courtesy Jess Katz)  I can’t find anything about my brother who escaped to Russia, Abram wrote in the final lines of in his 1990 testimonial. My daughter wrote all kinds of letters to try to find him. We can’t find him. Last month, Katz  —   a      who works for a software company in New York City and has blogged about her family’s Jewish roots  —   had extra time on her hands as she recovered from minor surgery at home. She decided to take up the search. After decades of tedious research and   it took Katz two weeks to find Chaim’s son. It was a success born of an improbable alchemy: the serendipity of social media, the generosity of helpful strangers, and access to technology that allowed distant relatives to bridge thousands of miles, a   time difference and a language barrier. With the help of a Jewish heritage website, JewishGen. org, Katz contacted a genealogist who quickly tracked down Russian military documents with Chaim’s name and army unit, dated 1942. Katz shared the documents in a Jewish Facebook group, where she was directed to another Russian forum, where  —   with the help of Google Translate  —   Katz’s post caught the attention of an Israeli woman who matched Chaim’s last name to a man on a Russian social networking site called Classmates. That man, it turned out, was Evgeny Belzhitsky. Katz created an account on Classmates and sent Belzhitsky a message. He responded right away: “He said ‘I don’t have the words to explain my emotions right now, but I want to send you a picture of my father. Do you see any resemblance? ’” Katz says. “My sisters and my mom are sitting on the bed together, and my mom just screams, because he looks just like my grandfather. ”    Abram (left) and his brother Chaim, both at age 32. (Courtesy Jess Katz)  But her family wanted to be certain, so they asked Belzhitsky what his father’s birth date was. He answered with the correct date: Nov. 17, 1918. “We were shaking, we were crying, we couldn’t believe it,” Katz says. The next morning, she says, the family met for the first time over Skype, and spent two hours talking about their families and their shared history, about Abram and Chaim. On different continents, the lives of the two brothers followed remarkably similar paths: both became successful tailors after the war. Both married women eight years younger. Both were gentle, doting fathers. And each had searched for the other, writing letter after letter, hoping his sibling had somehow survived.   [This    World War II veteran reconnects with wartime love after 71 years apart]   Neither lived to see last month’s reunion. Abram died five years ago at age 95; Chaim succumbed to a brain tumor at 51. Belzhitsky showed his American relatives a photograph of his father’s grave. It was so much to process, Katz says  —   family lost and found, all at once. Her mother was especially moved by the bittersweet reconnection. “It’s difficult for her to know that her dad never got to find his brother,” Katz says. “It’s difficult to think that this is all my grandpa would have wanted  —   to have his brother, to have a nephew  —   and I’m sure Chaim also would have wanted that. So it’s a blessing, but there’s also a lot of pain. ” Since their first Skype session, the newfound relatives have been in touch daily. They send messages to each other over Facebook, sharing stories and photos. They are trying to make up for so much lost time, Katz says, and they hope to arrange a visit as soon as they can.

(Courtesy Jess Katz)  And they want other people, those who are still hoping and hunting for lost relatives, to know that a miracle is always possible. “Since I shared the post, I’ve gotten a lot of messages from families who are also still searching and asking how I did it,” Katz says. “We want to show that there are these different tools that technology can offer now  —   these Facebook groups, Google Translate  —   and that can really help in finding relatives. We want to give hope to families who are still searching for loved ones. ” The reunion came at a particularly poignant moment, she says: this year, Holocaust Remembrance Day falls on the May 5 anniversary of Abram’s liberation from Mauthausen, the beginning of his long search for his sibling. “I wish he was here to see this,” Katz says. “I can’t even imagine the love and joy he would have felt to have found his brother. ” But there were so many lucky turns that led her to find Chaim so quickly, she says  —   so many people who helped her at precisely the right moment. She likes to think the brothers might have had something to do with that. “I feel like they somehow orchestrated it,” she says, “and they are beaming down with happiness now. ” Want more inspiring news?

2016-05-03,"Editor’s Note: In our current issue, we have a piece by Jay Nordlinger on John Dos Passos  —   specifically, on The Theme Is Freedom, a collection that Dos Passos published in 1956. Mr. Nordlinger is now expanding his piece in Impromptus. For Part I, go here. The Sacco and Vanzetti case was one of the great convulsive cases of the 1920s. It caused a significant cleavage in American life. I’ll quote Dos Passos: The case left an immense bitterness between those who believed the men were innocent and those who believed they were guilty. Every now and then, there’s a case that breaks up friendships. I think, from the decade of the 2000s, of the Iraq War. (The Florida recount was pretty bitter, too. And, before that, the Clinton impeachment drama.) I think right now of the Trump phenomenon and what it has done to Americans on the right. Anyway, I will quote Dos Passos (who was writing in the 1950s about the ’20s and Sacco and Vanzetti): I remember receiving a letter from a man I’d liked and admired and been on friendly terms with in college formally breaking off relations. Since we hadn’t seen each other for many years, and he lived on one side of the country and I on the other, it puzzled me that he should have taken the trouble. Undoubtedly he felt he was doing his duty as a citizen. Here is Dos Passos on the Communists: In this country they were then a small sect striving without too much success to form their own unions. Their strength was that they had a definite set of convictions they held to with religious fervor. Their movement offered men and women who subjected themselves to the discipline dedicated careers, the selfrighteous assurance that they were better than other men, and that sense of participation in history that takes the place of religion for the Marxist. I have seen that, again and again. I’m sure you have too. Okay, what was the Communists’ weakness? Their weakness was that they had no way of appealing to the desire for personal independence and to the basic creed that there should be fair play for all, which, thank God, is just as strong among American working people as it is in the rest of the population. Another sentence on the Communists, and their success: Their great success lay, as it does today [the 1950s] in the skill with which they managed to direct the thinking of halfeducated and inexperienced young people among Americans of middle class origin. Am I way out of bounds to think of Bernie Sanders and his legions of college supporters? Sanders spent his honeymoon, or something close to it, in the Soviet Union. (New York mayor Bill de Blasio spent his in the Castros’ Cuba.) Dos Passos traveled to the Soviet Union in 1928. (  I’m tempted to say.) The Bolshevik state was young: just eleven years old. On the way, Dos Passos stopped in Helsinki. My series is not intended to be a literary one  —   more of a political one  —   but I want to give you a line from Dos, concerning Helsinki. And he is using the old, Swedish name for that city: Helsingfors is all right except that the sea isn’t salt here and the town looks like a cleaner Duluth and they have run entirely out of this year’s supply of darkness. That is very Dos Passos, that line. Dos Passos talked with a couple of young people in Leningrad. The state was young, but not so young to them  —   who knew scarcely anything else. It was as hard for them to imagine a time when Marxism had not been a rule of conduct as it would be for an American high school kid to doubt the desirability of the open shop or the Monroe Doctrine. Dos Passos wrote those words in 1928. Here he is in the  ’50s, commenting on what he wrote: Lord how things have changed. Marxism is still the rule of conduct beyond that frontier.   …     Meanwhile the Western world has shuffled up all its convictions. If you talk to an American high school boy in this year of 1955 he’ll tell you that the open shop is the stratagem of designing businessmen. If he ever heard of the Monroe Doctrine he takes a dim view of it. And in 2016? Share article on FacebookshareTweet  Dos Passos is talking to a Russian  —   a Soviet, really. He is a technician of some kind. The Soviet tells him that Americans have come up with fantastic “industrial techniques. ” But “we are learning your system.   …     It is like arithmetic, once it is invented anybody can learn it. What did your Shakespeare say? The villainy you taught me I shall execute. ” That line is from The Merchant of Venice. It’s usually “The villainy you teach me,” not “taught me,” but no matter: What an interesting encounter. Here is Dos Passos looking back in the ’50s: Everything I thought and wrote that summer [of 1928] was based upon the notion, which Josef Stalin was immediately to prove false, that the violent phase of the Russian revolution was over, that the drive of communist fanaticism was slackening, that the magnificent energies of the Russian people would soon be set to work on making life worth living. I believe that those energies should still be let loose, to make life worth living. Take a break for a little humor. Again, Dos Passos is writing in the ’50s: Stalin’s own taste had great influence on the arts. What he liked in the theater was the endless repetition of “Swan Lake. ” Well, in this respect, and only in this respect, I may be a bit of a Stalinist   …     P. S. Hitler is known for his love of Wagner. But what he loved above all  —   his favorite work of art  —   was The Merry Widow, the operetta by Franz Lehár. He bestowed awards on the composer, personally. P. P. S. I know a woman  —   that’s present tense, “know”  —   who met Lehár and says that he was one of the most charming men she has ever met in her life. The most throttling thing in Dos Passos’s report from the Soviet Union is a brief account of a meeting he had: a meeting with, a visit to, a couple. He was an Englishman, she a Russian. The Englishman had gone to the Soviet Union for idealistic reasons. Now he and his wife were scared out of their minds, and were looking for a way to leave. Dos Passos did not want to believe them. His account is only two and a half pages long, but they are hard to forget. “Did I know about Kronstadt? It was learning the truth about Kronstadt that had turned it all into a bitter nightmare for him”  —   the “him” being the husband, the Englishman. Kronstadt, remember, was a naval fortress on an island in the Gulf of Finland. In 1921, Soviet sailors, soldiers, and others rebelled against Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Needless to say, they were crushed like bugs. Since then, “Kronstadt” has served as a metaphor.   and   have spoken of their personal Kronstadts. The term “Kronstadt” has two definitions. It can refer to the moment of one’s disillusionment with the Communist Party. Or it can refer to the moment at which one took a stand against the Party. The crucial moment, for some, was the   pact. For others, Khrushchev’s “secret speech. ” For others, the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution. And so on. Back to the Englishman whom Dos Passos met: His Kronstadt was, literally, Kronstadt. I’m going to quote Dos Passos some more. Bear in mind that the Cheka, or Tcheka, were the Soviet secret police the Okhrana were their predecessor, the czarist secret police. The sailors who revolted at Kronstadt were the men who had made the October days [who had won the Russian Revolution]   …     There was no doubt that the revolt was a great danger.   …     Undoubtedly it had to be suppressed. The loyal troops recaptured the fortress after fierce fighting. The sailors capitulated on terms. The Tcheka agents had run like rabbits at the first sign of danger. They didn’t dare come back until three days after the troops had recaptured the place. But then the prisoners were turned over to the Tcheka   …     And the Chekists, many of them, had been members of the old Okhrana, czarists, sadists, perverts of every hideous kind  —   “there’s no cruelty like Russian cruelty, not even Chinese [this is the Englishman talking]. They butchered even the miserable prostitutes in the brothels of Kronstadt. Some of the Tcheka agents had with them copies of Le Jardin des Supplices written by that filthy Frenchman to use as a textbook when their imagination failed. It’s a nightmare, I tell you. ” I’m going to continue, with Dos: I got to my feet a little dizzily. It was terror I’d seen in the man’s eyes   …     [and] in the woman’s nervous step. I felt sick. I cleared my throat. “But the Tcheka’s gone. [It was reorganized and renamed in 1922.]   …     They had most of them shot. The terror is over. ” “You can say that.   …     You can come and go when you please. It’ll never be over for us till we die or they get us, unless we can get out. We are doomed. You know they always come at night. No arrests are ever seen. No one who sees them ever dares tell anyone. Nothing is ever known. ” It was a relief to get out into the casual street   …       Give Dos Passos credit for writing this, not later, in the 1950s, but right then, in the 1920s. Many writers withheld what they witnessed. Dos did too, to a degree. Here he is talking to us in the 1950s: How hard it is to write truthfully. Reading over these lines I keep remembering things I forgot to put in. Why did I forget to put in about the enlarged photographs of Lenin as a baby I saw in the ikon corner in the peasants’ houses instead of the Christ Child? Why did I neglect people’s hints about Stalin? He explains himself with the following lines, I think: Just like every other American, I’d done my best to see the good, but the last impression I came away with was fear, fear of the brutal invisible intricate machinery of the police state. No fear was ever better founded. Consider another fear  —   a fear of Dos Passos’s: “the fear of writing something that would be seized on by   propaganda in the West. ” Dos Passos, in the 1920s, was not ready to be an  . “I was trying to be neutral, above the battle like Goethe. ” But eventually he would have to choose sides, and he chose well  —   and bravely. So, I will see you later for Part III. That will include Harlan County and Spain and more. Thank you for joining me, and Dos Passos, for these unusual notes. "
2016-05-04,"Tiny homes, which can be as little as 50 to 300 square feet, are growing in popularity as a solution for the homeless. In Chicago, advocates want to build tiny houses to serve a specific marginalized group  ” homeless youth, especially those who identify as LGBTQ. ”Most of the cities in the country that have already implemented housing tiny homes for the homeless are doing it for the chronically homeless or veterans, so no one yet is doing it specifically for the youth target population,” says activist Tracy Baim, who spearheaded a Chicago Tiny Home Summit April   at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Baim says tiny homes could provide freestanding independent housing instead of what is typically available for young adults seeking shelter. ”They’re living in group homes, where shared showers, where violence and sexual assaults can happen,” she says. ”Your stuff is stolen constantly.” The summit, which aimed to discuss the practicalities and experiences of building tiny houses, displayed the tiny home design that won the American Institute of Architects’ competition to build a tiny house community for Chicago. ”You actually enter through a breezeway, kind of a covered porch area that’s 8 feet deep,” says Lon Stousland, part of the   team that won the competition. Their prototype is fairly big by tiny home standards. A brick facade surrounds the bright yellow front door. Inside, there’s a twin bed, a bathroom and a combined kitchen and living room area. ”This is closer to 300 square feet,” says architect Terry Howell, another team member. The third team member, Marty Sandberg, says there is another way the structure is different from other tiny houses, ”We designed this to actually be one of a series of row homes,” Sandberg says. Lala Thomas, William Okamura and Maria Cwiklik are three    who were formerly homeless. Now, they live in a transitional housing shelter, and all go to school. They were part of a group chosen to offer design suggestions about what a Chicago tiny home should look like. Thomas was a little surprised by the size. ”Well, I really didn’t like it, I’m going to be honest, because . .. you really can’t put that much stuff in that little house,” Thomas says. ”I mean, I just think it was just . .. it would be bigger than that.” Okamura likes the idea. ”By having those walls up, I’d feel 100 times safer than being outside with nothing,” Okamura says. Cwiklik says even though planning may be in an early stage, she’s optimistic about a tiny home village for youth in Chicago. ”As long as we get more support and as long as we get more youth involved in this program,” Cwiklik says, ”it’s going to happen.” Tiny Homes Might Need To Be A Guerrilla Building Movement, But there are obstacles. Zoning Attorney Danielle Meltzer Cassel says in addition to building codes and zoning ordinances, there is the ”not in my backyard” or   NIMBY opposition from residents. She says advocates in Chicago must face a dose of reality. ”If this is pitched as something that is for the folks who are the most needy in our society, the door’s going to slam shut,” she says. In Seattle, activists involved in the tiny home movement have been doing more building and less planning. Melinda Nichols, with the Low Income Housing Institute in the city, says so far volunteers have built 50 to 60 temporary tiny homes under 120 square feet. ”Because people are standing out in the rain waiting for a place to live,” Nichols says. ”It’s a crisis, and the way to respond to those things is to do something right now.” In Nashville, the Rev. Jeff Obafemi Carr with Infinity Fellowship says advocates have to be inventive as they try to provide needed housing. His group raised money to build six tiny homes on wheels without seeking permission. ”Cities and municipalities don’t know what to do with it. The code and zoning laws are antiquated. So there’s going to take a mix of guerrilla tiny home building and planned development,” Carr says. In Chicago, Baim says the next step for advocates is to create a privately funded tiny home village pilot. She says that will show developers, city government and Chicago residents how tiny houses could play a huge role in making it safer for young people with no place to call home."
2016-05-05,"De facto Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump celebrated Cinco de Mayo on Thursday. And being a Twitter aficionado, he couldn’t resist telling the world. ”Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill,” he declared in celebration of the holiday that commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862. ”I love Hispanics!” he added. His message immediately caused a Twitter frenzy. Some were frustrated at what they felt was Trump pandering to Hispanics: And also, everyone had questions: Does Trump Grill even sell taco bowls? No, reported Buzzfeed’s Andrew Kaczynski. But wait, were we sure? Apparently the Trump Grill Cafe (a distinct entity from the Trump Grill) is serving a dish called ”Taco fiesta!” which may be what he was eating. Has a reputable food publication reviewed a Trump cafe taco bowl? Why, yes (Eater, scathingly). What does Chipotle think? Naturally, that its burrito bowls are better than Trump Grill’s. What reading material was stacked underneath his meal? Possibly a People magazine story on Marla Maples. It’s general election season, everyone, and no stone will go unturned. Trump’s big demographic problems, But then, there is a serious side to the    fest. For all that Trump says, ”I love Hispanics,” they really do not love him. His favorability ratings among that group of voters are nothing short of abysmal, according to several polls. His   rating with Hispanic voters was   in a March Gallup poll, with 77 percent having an unfavorable view of him. In comparison, his fellow Republicans Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and Marco Rubio earned scores of   1, and 6, respectively. (Admittedly, they were less   to respondents than Trump is.) Democrats fared far better: Sanders came in with a net favorability of 19, and Clinton at 33. That’s a huge problem for a party that has already known for years that it needed a boost among Hispanic voters. In its 2013 autopsy, the Republican Party advised its candidates to ”engage” more with Hispanic voters in advance of 2016. This wasn’t a futile quest, they stressed: George W. Bush proved that the GOP could perform well among Hispanic voters, winning 44 percent of that vote in 2004. But in 2012, Mitt Romney only won around 27 percent of Hispanic voters. And as the Hispanic population grows (and fast) the bar is only being set higher for Republicans. That group’s share of the electorate has grown by 17 percent since 2012, according to the Pew Research Center, compared to 2 percent for white  . Put another way, Hispanics make up an estimated 12 percent of eligible voters this year, per Pew. That’s almost double the 7 percent share in 2000. In part due to that fast growth among Hispanics, pollster Whit Ayres wrote in 2015 that a candidate this year wouldn’t win with George W. Bush’s 58 percent of the white vote and 26 percent of the nonwhite vote (including minorities beyond   Hispanics). Trump could maybe pick up more support as November approaches. But a recent poll suggests he would have a massive amount of ground to make up in the next six months. Only 14 percent of   registered voters in a Wednesday CNN poll said they would support Trump in a race against Clinton (again, compared to George W. Bush’s 26 percent final share of the 2004   vote, McCain’s 19 percent in 2008, and Romney’s 17 percent in 2012). The GOP knows it needs better Hispanic outreach, It’s true that for lots of Hispanics voters, immigration isn’t the top issue, and that it isn’t just a Hispanic issue. Still, the GOP did recognize in 2013 that a more welcoming immigration policy could endear them to more Hispanic voters. ”[A]mong the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,” the RNC wrote in its autopsy. ”If we do not, our Party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.” Trump, of course, favors building a wall along the U. S.  border and deporting roughly 11 million people who are in the U. S. illegally (a study released Thursday found that that policy would slice 2 percent off US GDP). All of which is to say that as Trump has a long way to go beyond tweets of taco bowls to reach out to Hispanic voters. With reporting from Jessica Taylor."
2016-05-06,"     Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday said he might seek to pay back investors in U. S. government debt less than they were owed ”if the economy crashed,” raising doubts about whether Treasury bonds would be reliable in a future administration. The comments were striking because, historically, U. S. government debt has been treated as sacrosanct, the safest investment in the world, and a pillar of global financial stability. Speaking on CNBC, Trump said he embraces the idea of taking on debt, given that borrowers can try to tweak the terms later on. Indeed, as a businessman, Trump has used the bankruptcy laws on several occasions to reduce his companies’ debts. ”I am the king of debt. I do love debt. I love debt. I love playing with it,” Trump said. ”Do you believe that we, in terms of the United States, need to pay a hundred cents on the dollar, or do you think that there’s actually ways that we can renegotiate that debt?” CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked him. ”Yeah, I think  —   look, I have borrowed, knowing that you can pay back with discounts. And I have done very well,” Trump said. ”I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal, and if the economy was good, it was good, so, therefore, you can’t lose.” Banks, investors and ordinary people around the world rely on bonds issued by the Treasury Department as more dependable than cash. Doubts about whether the debt is trustworthy could influence interest rates, which are connected to Treasury rates, throughout the economy. For example, home loans and credit cards could become more expensive as banks, concerned about whether their Treasury bonds would be made good, restricted lending to protect themselves. While Trump’s precise plans were unclear from the interview, if the U. S. government did not pay some of its debts in full, creditors would come to see the country as an unreliable borrower, said Douglas   an economist who heads the conservative American Action Forum think tank. “You’re Puerto Rico,” he said, referring to the fact that the U. S. territory is on the verge of defaulting on its debt. “That’s not a good thing. ” ”The Treasury Department could go to people who hold the debt and say, look, we’re not going to be able to pay you back,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the   American Enterprise Institute. ”That would be an outrageous thing to do.  …      It could introduce chaos.” Pressed further on his comments on CNBC, Trump acknowledged that the situation he would face as president would be different than that of a commercial real estate developer, making ambiguous statements about how far he’d go to revise the terms of U. S. government bonds. ”We’re in a different situation with the country,” he said. ”Now you are talking about, you know, you’re talking about something that’s very, very fragile, and it has to be handled very, very carefully.” ”But let’s be clear. I mean, you’re not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds that the U. S. has already issued?” CNBC’s Becky Quick asked him. ”No. I don’t want to renegotiate the bonds,” Trump said. ”But I think you can do discounting, I think, you know, depending on where interest rates are, I think you can buy back  —   you can  —   I’m not talking about with a renegotiation, but you can buy back at discounts.” Trump seemed to be saying that the government could repurchase debt that was issued previously at costly interest rates, borrowing the money to do so at today’s inexpensive interest rates. ”I think there are times for us to refinance,” he said. ”I could see   renegotiations, where we borrow   at very low rates.” It is unclear whether such a strategy would meaningfully improve the government’s financial position. Since the government operates at a deficit, the Treasury would have to borrow even more money on a monthly basis to make the purchases and might have to offer investors more expensive interest rates on new debt anyway. U. S. government debt has remained crucial to the global financial system over the past few years, especially as the global economy has weakened. Still, doubts have arisen before, particularly when Republican congressional leaders threatened not to raise the federal limit on borrowing without policy concessions from the Obama administration in 2011. Ultimately, the cap was raised, though not before the Standard & Poor’s rating agency reduced the rating of the debt from the firm’s highest grade. Jim Tankersley contributed."
2016-05-07,"Until this week I hadn’t noticed the similarities between Hillary Clinton and   Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke of the German Empire. The comparison is apt. Both leaders spent years planning a rapid and decisive assault against their opponents. And both leaders unexpectedly found themselves bogged down in a   war. Moltke the Younger is held responsible for the failure of the Schlieffen Plan, the German general staff’s blueprint for the invasion of Belgium and northern France at the outset of the First World War. Its objective: Capture Paris before France and its ally Russia counterattack. Brilliant in theory but vulnerable in practice: a fair description of the Clinton plan. Hillary spent years intimidating potential rivals. Deval Patrick, Cory Booker, John Kerry said no. Elizabeth Warren said no. Joe Biden played Hamlet for a few months, said no. The remaining opposition  —   Chafee, O’Malley, Webb  —   were jokes. Clinton dispatched them with ease. RELATED: White Lies Matter, Bernie won’t quit.

He’s more than an annoyance, the angry uncle that won’t shut up. The opportunity cost is huge. Clinton wanted a unified assault on the Republicans, to spend the spring and early summer defining the GOP as radical, its presumptive nominee a misogynistic bigot. Now the situation is complicated. She still has to run against Bernie while Donald Trump has an open field. She still has to travel the country while Trump sits in his skyscraper and manipulates the media to raise her negatives higher than they already are. Traditional campaigns deploy the saturation bombing of television ads. Trump orders the precision strike, the verbal kill shot that diminishes opponents to insignificance:   Jeb, pathological Ben Carson, little Marco Rubio, lyin’ Ted Cruz. The latest addition: crooked Hillary. Like the Republicans who fell to Trump, she’ll find it difficult to escape the label. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Worse for Clinton is the fact that Trump’s criticisms harmonize with Sanders’s. They go after her on trade, on the speaking fees, on cronyism. They point out she is an insider, they outsiders. They needle her foreign policy decisions, and remind the public that they opposed the war in Iraq (or so Trump says). Trump’s freedom from dogmatism and manners allows him to attack Clinton from any angle, any viewpoint, no matter how base. Her response? Worrisome. She plays to Trump’s strengths, reminds us of her vulnerabilities. She called Trump “a loose cannon,” which is exactly why his supporters love him. They want unpredictability, chaos, and destruction in the Beltway. It’s the reason for his campaign. RELATED: Hillary’s Woman Problem: Most Women Don’t Like Her, “Loose cannon” is only an insult to authority figures, to high school principals, coaches of amateur soccer leagues. Americans like loose cannons. Trump’s problem isn’t that he’s a loose cannon. It’s that he’s a horrible person.

If there is good news for Clinton it is that her   war, like that of the Imperial Germans, will end with a peace treaty with a Marxist power. Yet the conflict will endure long after Sanders departs the scene. I wonder if Clinton has the political capacity, the dexterity, the subtlety and wit to repel Trump’s assault, put him on the defensive. Can she hold on until reinforcements arrive in November? Her supporters must hope so. The alternative would be confirmation of the analogy with von Moltke, of Hillary Clinton as the inept scion of a doomed empire.,"
2016-05-08," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull fired the starting gun on Sunday on one of the longest election campaigns in Australia’s history, against the backdrop of a flagging economy and heated debate over sensitive political issues like asylum seekers.  Turnbull officially called federal elections for July 2, several months earlier than originally planned, using rarely invoked powers to dissolve both houses of parliament after the upper house Senate repeatedly blocked government legislation.  The federal poll throws up the specter of more political instability in Australia, where infighting among the leading parties has resulted in a revolving door to the top job at a time when Australia is trying to rebalance its economy away from a     mining boom. Turnbull, considered a moderate in the conservative Liberal   coalition government, became the fourth leader in two years when he deposed   predecessor Tony Abbott in an internal party coup in September. He goes to the polls as Australia, renowned for its almost unscathed survival of the global financial crisis, finally shows signs of a slowdown.  Its future, once pegged to iron ore and steel, is now likely to hinge on its success in grabbing export markets for agriculture, education and pharmaceuticals in a rapidly modernizing Asia. ”We live in an era when the scale and pace of economic change is unprecedented through all of human history,” Turnbull told reporters after setting the election in motion. ”In a few years more than half of the world’s middle class will be living in Asia,” Turnbull said. ”The opportunities for Australia are enormous.”    The government is running    in opinion polls with the   Labor opposition, a sharp turnaround from Turnbull’s honeymoon period, during which he was one of the most popular leaders in Australian history. Labor leader Bill Shorten has been quick to paint Turnbull, a   lawyer and former tech entrepreneur, and the coalition as friends of big business.  ”They are pursuing a policy to reward big tax cuts to major corporations,” Shorten, who has promised major spending on health and education, told reporters. The government’s federal budget announced last week was notably short on   incentives as falling commodity prices ate into state revenues. There has also been disappointment in some quarters with Turnbull, whom many expected to distance himself from the   policies of Abbott on issues such as immigration and climate change. As Turnbull was speaking in Canberra, police arrested 66 people at a protest against fossil fuels on Newcastle Harbour, one of the world’s biggest coal export ports about two hours’ drive north of Sydney.  Australia’s hardline immigration policy, under which asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia are sent for processing to camps on Nauru and on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, has also led to recent protests.  The harsh conditions and reports of systemic child abuse at the camps, which house asylum seekers fleeing violence in Syria, Iraq, South Asia and Africa, have drawn wide criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups.  The winner should at least find it easier to pass legislation because the   double dissolution election for both houses of parliament should ease the political deadlock that has characterized Australian politics since the last election in 2013.

President Donald Trump will get a chance to patch up   ties this week when he meets with NATO allies still rattled by his failure on an earlier trip to embrace the principle that an attack against one member is an attack against all.

2016-05-09,"Lending Club, the online mortgage and loan provider, pushed out Chief Executive and Chairman Renaud Laplanche after an internal review revealed the company sold $22 million in   loans to a single investor against instructions. The ouster, coupled with disappointing   results, sent shares of the San Francisco company  —   already down about 50 percent over the past year  —   tumbling 25. 1 percent at the open of Monday trading, to $5. 22. While the $22 million of loans in question is small  —   it had $2. 75 billion in loan originations in the quarter ended March 31  —   the fact that the sale to one investor violated company policy was enough to end the tenure of Laplanche. “A key principle of the company is maintaining the highest levels of trust with borrowers, investors, regulators, stockholders and employees,” the company said in a statement. President Scott Sanborn was named acting CEO and will assume both roles, assisted by director Hans Morris, who was named executive chairman, until a permanent chief executive is found. The internal probe also found that “certain personnel” knew that the March and April loans sold to the single investor failed to meet that investor’s criteria, the company said. Three unidentified senior executives were either fired or resigned over the incident, the company said. The loans were later repurchased from the investor at par. Lending Club said the probe also uncovered the fact that its board was never told of personal interests held in a   fund in which the company was weighing an investment. The company reported a profit of $4. 1 million, or 1 cent per share, in the quarter  —   below the 5 cents that Wall Street was expecting. Revenue grew 88 percent to $152. 3 million."
2016-05-10,"Bernie Sanders won the West Virginia Democratic primary on Tuesday over Hillary Clinton. The Vermont senator’s victory bolsters his decision to stay in the race even though the delegate math is heavily in Clinton’s favor. Sanders won Indiana last week and could win several other states slated to vote this month. ”West Virginia is a   state, and like many other states in this country  —   including Oregon  —   working people are hurting. And what the people of West Virginia said tonight, and I believe the people of Oregon and Kentucky will say next week, is that we need an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent,” Sanders told supporters at a rally in Oregon on Tuesday evening. That state votes next Tuesday. West Virginia is a tough loss for Clinton to be sure, especially given the fact that she easily won the state in the 2008 Democratic primary over Barack Obama. But the bigger picture for her campaign doesn’t change: Clinton’s delegate lead over Sanders remains virtually insurmountable. Because the state’s 29 pledged delegates will be split proportionally between the two, Sanders needs a huge margin of victory in order to cut into Clinton’s nearly 300   advantage. When superdelegates are included, her margin grows to 774 delegates. According to NPR’s analysis going into Tuesday, to get a pledged majority, Sanders needed 65 percent of all remaining pledged delegates. Clinton needed just 34 percent. With superdelegates, Sanders needed 36 percent of all remaining delegates Clinton needed just 14 percent. The Mountaineer State played to many of Sanders’ strengths: It’s a heavily white,   state where voters are angry about the Obama administration’s policies. And with the GOP race virtually decided, independent voters who typically have broken for Sanders could cast ballots in the Democratic primary. According to exit polls, 91 percent of the electorate was white, while just 7 percent was   or Hispanic. A third of voters were independents, and those voters broke for Sanders by 47 percentage points. Only 27 percent of voters said the next president should continue Obama’s policies. Voters also were opposed to trade deals, a top issue with Sanders. More than half of voters said that trade with other countries takes away U. S. jobs, while 36 percent of voters said it creates jobs. Clinton’s loss highlights some of her main weaknesses, especially with white men. She came under fire from the state’s important coal industry after she remarked last summer that ”we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business” as she was talking about ways to promote alternative   businesses. Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters came from a coal household, and Sanders won those voters with 63 percent of the vote. To Clinton’s frustration, the fact that Sanders extends his winning streak further underscores that she doesn’t have the nomination fully sewn up, even though her team largely has been looking ahead to a general election matchup. ”I’m looking forward to debating Donald Trump come the fall,” she told a crowd while campaigning in Kentucky earlier Tuesday. In an interview with NPR’s Steve Inskeep last week, the Vermont senator reiterated he would stay in the race ”until the last vote is cast” after the Washington, D. C. Democratic primary on June 14. And he continues to point to general election poll numbers that show him running strongest against Trump, hoping that will sway superdelegates to his side before the July convention in Philadelphia. ”I think we are perpetuating the political revolution by significantly increasing the level of political activity that we’re seeing in this country,” Sanders told NPR. Clinton did win the Nebraska Democratic vote on Tuesday night, but those results were nonbinding. The state party used a different caucus on March 5 to determine its delegate allocation where Sanders won 15 pledged delegates Clinton’s 10. Trump, the de facto GOP nominee, easily won both the West Virginia and Nebraska primaries on Tuesday too. Both contests essentially were foregone conclusions after both Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich withdrew last week after Trump won the Indiana primary. Both states are expected to go for the GOP nominee in November, but even in the Democratic primary there were schisms that exposed opportunities for Trump in the fall  —   and that suggest why Democrats aren’t confident about a general election win despite Clinton’s early advantage. According to exit polls, just 33 percent of Democratic primary voters said they definitely would vote for the Democratic nominee 27 percent said they would vote for Trump.   percent of Sanders voters said they would support Trump in the fall, while just 23 percent would vote for Clinton."
2016-05-11,"Austin Petersen once collected me in his Ford pickup, wearing a   khaki shorts, and a baseball cap. We stopped off at a convenience store in the Old Town in Alexandria, Virginia, where he bought a packet of Turkish Gold blend Camels, and proceeded to tell me why I needed to advocate for gun ownership in my home country, England. [I was in a blue suit, with a blue shirt, a red tie, and a white pocket square. I can’t forget it, because the British press won’t let me. That day Petersen and I took a picture that would be used to label me a “  extremist” in Britain: awkwardly holding a pistol (with its shipping material still around it).   How the tables have turned.  When I met Petersen in downtown Washington, D. C. this week, he was the politico, and I was the sloppy journalist. His ruddy grey suit, crisp white shirt, and blue tie all said: “That me [in cargo shorts] was me when I wasn’t [running for office]. ” In fact that is what he literally said as I quizzed him on his sharp new look at the famous Old Ebbitt Grill just a few minutes walk from the same White House that Petersen wants to occupy in 2017. But since he’s running to be the candidate of the Libertarian Party, that probably won’t happen. He may though, preside over a record result for the free market, small government party  —   if optimistic commentators are to be believed. Libertarian Party membership is surging following Donald Trump’s (probable) win of the Republican candidacy, he tells me. But the party took just 0. 99 per cent of the vote in 2012, 0. 4 per cent in 2008, 0. 32 per cent in 2004, and 0. 36 per cent in 2000. Surely the only way is up? And Petersen’s combination of social liberalism and fiscal conservatism could help propel him  —   if he gets the party’s nod  —   to a more respectable position in the general election in November.  In his own words, Petersen’s politics can be best summed up by the phrase: “I believe in a world where gay married couples can defend their marijuana fields with fully automatic machine guns”. His campaign slogan: “Taking over the government to leave everyone alone”. Cue some confused applause from within conservative and liberal circles alike.  But his real challenge is gazumping the “favourite” candidate  —   Gov. Gary Johnson  —   who critics refer to as tired and past his prime, and supporters back as the only   candidate. The other option for libertarians this cycle is cyber security mogul and all round eccentric John Mcafee. Petersen, however, has mostly good things to say about both men, describing Mcafee as “very appealing” with a “melodious voice”. He calls him an “attractive man” with “gravitas” though he does believe that Mcafee is a policy lightweight apart from on the issue of cybersecurity. He adds that some of the things the web guru blurts out can be “off putting”. Petersen’s quest for presentational excellence was never better displayed than at the Libertarian Party debate. A poll on LP. org had him winning the debate by 31 per cent to Gary Johnson’s 28 per cent. Mr. Mcafee was behind on 18 per cent.  What caused the victory? “Mr Johnson has trouble articulating his ideas,” says Petersen, again, cushioning his criticism by calling his competitor an “attractive man” with “athleticism” (the    former Republican governor is a triathlete). But, Petersen says, he’s “not quite on par with someone who wants to be commander in chief”. “Are you?” I wondered, knowing the reputation Petersen has online for being somewhat of a “troll”  —   perhaps an unfair description of a man who simply seeks to challenge the status quo at every opportunity. He describes it better, or more traditionally, as “American contrarianism”.  So how does a    from Independence, Missouri who was raised on a horse farm on the edge of a town called Liberty (I’m not making any of this up) convince conservative America to support him? Especially with his socially liberal attitudes. “This is 2016, and conservatives are so desperate they are considering a libertarian for the first time ever”.  Maybe describing oneself as the candidate for the desperate isn’t the greatest start, but he does point to how the recent U. S. Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage turned a lot of social conservatives into libertarians. Not by supporting the ruling, but in shifting their argument from banning same sex marriage to one that involves getting government out of the business of marriage in the first instance. “Now we’re libertarians and we want government out of marriage,” he chuckles, adding: “People accuse me of speaking in bumper stickers, but this is the year of Donald Trump. If you cannot break it down in a sentence  …    ” I get it. And that’s exactly what he does, perhaps a consequence of having been the editor of the Libertarian Republic website, Petersen manages to boil things down to a tweet, even in spoken word.  “You own your life, you own your body, you ought to be able to do with it as you please” he argues. “As long as you don’t harm anyone else”. Okay, two tweets. By this point I’m sure he’s going to win over many social conservatives. And we haven’t even reached the part where I ask him about transgender toilets. But that’s not really what he’s going for. Case in point:  “We’ve had transgender people in this country since we were founded,” he hyperbolises. “Who was a transgender founding father?” I enquired, hoping to break the biggest news story of my life. “Ben Franklin, perhaps, right? Haha. Many of them had some freaky practices”. Way to lose the crowd on both sides. Now transgendered people can use any bathrooms they want, but they’re also freaks. It’s fine  —   he was only kidding. But the way American politics is right now, each side of the fence appears to be a mine field, and the fence itself has   metal spikes. There’s no winning either way and Petersen knows it, so he goes with his gut instinct. “[Being kind to] people struggling with their sexuality  …     that’s what America is all about.. you can be whatever you want to be in this country. Yes I believe you have a biological sex, that’s just science. But this [debate] reeks of a media conspiracy, it drives traffic to websites. ”  Quite right, not least his own, which has its own section for   news, with headlines like, “Transgender Athletes In Women’s Sports Spits In the Face of Feminism” and “New York Can Fine You $250k For ‘Misgendering’ Somebody”. His solution to this concern is similar to his solutions to most others. It’s the archetypal libertarian response: “The government needs to stay out of it  —   private establishments can make the decisions on their own”. No problems there, “But what about public toilets?” I ask. “Public toilets are already gender neutral for the most part. If its public  …     perhaps offer  …     a family room for instance. Fifty years ago these people existed and were using the bathrooms at their will. We should be compassionate to people because many of these people are suffering”. Flatly, it seems, Petersen won’t be dragged the route of “alt right” populism. His first instinct is liberty, which is why he notes: “Donald Trump is politically incorrect, but his politics are incorrect. I am politically incorrect, but my politics are correct”. I would have worried if he disagreed with himself. There’s contrarianism and there’s contrarianism. But I’ve also yet to hear anything politically incorrect from him yet. Granted, my bar is high, and he’s certainly not an   robot. But he’s hardly railing against the cultural status quo. More, he seems like a return to Ron     focus on policy responses to the problems facing America. The main policies being: Scrap it. Cut it. Get government out of it. Not too shabby. Petersen talks of the “$1. 5 trillion boondoggle” of the   fighter programme, his plan to audit the Pentagon, introduce a flat income tax “of around   per cent” and of his “one percent across the board” cut to all government departments.  “That includes the military” he boasts, adding: “I won’t endanger the national security of the American people”.  It’s a          Paul situation he finds himself in on foreign affairs.  “I would advocate that we start to draw down our military obligations around the world,” he begins, criticising the U. S. government for keep the country on a “Cold War footing”.  “I do believe that we need to not be the policemen of the world. I do believe that we need to pull our troops out from many of these countries”. Specifically, he lists Germany and Japan as places where U. S. troops no longer need to be stationed. “Are you a letters of marque kind of guy?” I ask.  Without missing a beat, in perhaps the most confident tone of our time together, Petersen shoots back: “You’re damn right”. I thought he was going to hug me just for asking the question. During America’s founding, he says, there were only a few U. S. government ships, but around one thousand privateers to protect U. S. interests against the British. I grumble something rude. In his world, instead of expensive,   military incursions, all you’d do is take people already trained by U. S. tax payer  —   former SEALs, former DELTA, “veterans itching to do us a favour”  —   and deploy them on the basis that they can sell any captured weaponry, loot, or claim bounties from the U. S. government for certain operations. Sounds crazy, right? But not until you speak to military officials or private military types do you realise this is a strategy that the U. S. is moving closer and closer towards anyway. In recent U. S. wars, companies like Blackwater (now Academi) and KBR have been doing work for the U. S. government. Using letters of marque only creates a more transparent and ostensibly constitutional way of doing this. And we’re back to the       discussion  —   which is probably unfair to Petersen as his demeanour is nothing like the two. He sits with with almost impeccable posture, intently listening while I blabber on about the Scottish National Party. I realise I’m supposed to be asking him questions, so I hit him with “Are you more like Bernie Sanders than Donald Trump?” “Absolutely not,” he shrieks, before shifting in his seat. “Actually, can I take that back?” “I don’t know what Donald Trump really believes”. At least Bernie Sanders agrees with him on marijuana legalisation, he notes. “The thing that bothers me is that Trump and Sanders are so similar  …     they both want the border wall for different reasons. I represent something radically different  —   more laissez faire”. “Goody, immigration,” I think. So what of it? “Every single economics study I’ve read,” he starts, “states that legal or not, immigration is a net benefit to people of the United States. While you have wage suppression, you also have price suppression. No one wants to pay $10 for a cheeseburger. ” “Were cheeseburgers $10 before we had mass immigration?” I enquire. (The price of a cheeseburger in the Old Ebbitt is $14. 00). “If we were to deport 11 million workers and migrant labourers, prices would necessarily rise because costs would come up”. Not necessarily untrue. But a lot of concern over mass immigration stems from cultural clashes, not just fiscal imperatives. But he does paint a stark picture of mass deportations in a   America. “In order for us to deport 11 million people you would have to create a government of totalitarian powers, which I am absolutely not willing to do”.  Again he returns to the founding fathers.  “King George tried to prohibit colonists settling the West. If King George had attempted to build a wall I’m certain the colonists would have dug under it, tunnelled under it, climbed over it, and done anything they could because life finds a way. ” “There’s a big difference between Jefferson and Los Zetas though?” I asked. “[Los Zetas are] a direct consequence of the war on drugs. We need to end the war on drugs and you will have less violence on borders  —   another libertarian solution”. Fair enough. But what about the cultural impacts? He lists America’s Mormon, Jewish, and Amish communities as those which in some instances in different parts of the country,   become insular, and do not necessarily integrate into their surrounding communities. Again, this is a liberty issue for Petersen. The freedom to be segregated. “It doesn’t bother me that people would come here to seek that kind of freedom,” he says. I tell him how uneasy I am about that, having seen the segregation of the Muslim communities in East London  —   my home town. “I really don’t worry about cultural cohesion because here in the United States we have such strong nationalism. Here you can’t turn your head left or right without seeing an American flag [and] in the United States we have a constitution that supersedes any attempt to impose an order not founded in natural law or civil liberties. So nationalism is a good thing? Finally, some right wing red meat. “[But it] is a double edged sword” he adds, before telling me that while he supports a UK exit from the European Union and “very much likes Nigel Farage”  —   he shies away from the UK Independence Party’s nationalistic side.  “But if I can’t fly a U. S. flag on an American university campus without being called a fascist, isn’t that a problem?” I ask. “Student radicalism has always existed,” Petersen says as we pivot onto the issue of   and radical leftism across the country. “It is magnified now due to social media,” he remarks, “[and] we have a higher population, so we’re all at tighter quarters”. Also, he notes of student radicalism: “It is right in line with American contrarianism. America is a rebel nation”. He points to the environment on campuses in the 1960s and 1970s, noting that Thomas Jefferson said: “God forbid we should ever be twenty years without a rebellion”.  “We have a cultural revolution every 10 years now” he says  —   not casting a judgment either way on whether these were good or bad “revolutions” we are seeing, but certainly alluding to a more   mindset than one that works within political cycles.  “If Trump were to take power and become President of the United States,” he concludes: “there would immediately be a counter revolution  …     It doesn’t surprise me to see these things, it doesn’t trouble me  …     free speech will always win out”. I feel by the end of this interview that maybe  —   though certain commentators would like you to believe it is the ‘Never Trump’ crowd that could make their voices heard by voting Libertarian  —   more support could come to someone like Petersen, if he is the nominee, from the ‘Never Hillary’ side of the Democrat Party and liberal movement. He appears to have all the patriotism of your average Trump voter (and with every   instinct) combined with a verve for the maximisation of individual social and cultural liberty.  While Republicans like Mary Matalin have defected from the GOP over Trump, she could do more harm to Hillary Clinton than she thinks by joining the Libertarian Party, even if that’s not the point.  As for other endorsements, Petersen is coy, but even the names Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush even  —   though not necessarily in as gleeful a way as libertarian leaning celebrities. “Please clap? No  …     Actually yes, I do want his endorsement. I want everyone’s endorsement. I don’t care who they supported before. I don’t care it if was Satan himself” Petersen jests, adding: “The principled populists [are part of my movement]. The unprincipled populists are all behind Donald Trump”.  And with that, we got the cheque, and trundled off down the street to talk about his cargo shorts, and how I needed to advocate for gun ownership in Britain. I’m pretty sure the next time I’m in the U. S. I won’t have the pleasure of visiting President Petersen at his new home on Pennsylvania Avenue. But something tells me that his charisma and drive is exactly what the Libertarian Party needs to grow beyond its most recent performances. Follow Raheem Kassam on Twitter "
2016-05-12,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. In his press conference this morning, Paul Ryan began the process of surrendering the Republican Party to Donald Trump. The key isn’t what he said. It’s what he didn’t say. A Legal Victory Against Obamacare —  For Now, In the CNN interview last week in which he refused to endorse Trump, Ryan used two key words. The first was “inherit. ” In winning the GOP presidential nomination, Ryan argued, Trump had “inherited something very special. ” The implication was clear: The Republican Party has a historic identity that Trump cannot overturn just because he got the most votes this year. In classic conservative fashion, Ryan argued for the value of tradition and warned against the danger of convulsive change. In so doing, he framed the challenge of unifying the GOP not in terms of an accommodation between Trump and himself but between Trump and the legends of Republicanism past: Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Trump, he said, must be “Lincoln and Reaganesque. ” And since the GOP can’t abandon its patron saints, it is Trump who must alter his views. “The bulk of the burden on unifying the party,” Ryan declared, “will have to come from our presumptive nominee. ” Ryan didn’t say that today. Instead, he talked about what “we need to do to unify the Republican Party” and “how we can bridge these gaps going forward. ” Rather than depicting Trump as a heretic who must accommodate himself to longstanding GOP orthodoxy, he described the real estate mogul as a different, but equally legitimate, kind of conservative. “I represent a wing of the conservative party you could say,” Ryan declared. “He brings —  he’s bringing a whole new wing to it. He’s bringing new voters we haven’t had for decades. That’s a positive thing. ” Now the accommodation is between Trump and Ryan, not Trump, Lincoln and Reagan. Now the “new wing” that Trump represents doesn’t constitute a betrayal of GOP tradition. It constitutes necessary, invigorating, change. The other key word that Ryan used a week ago —  but was absent today —  was “Kemp. ” For contemporary Republicans, the late Representative Jack Kemp, Ryan’s former political mentor, has become a symbol of conservative outreach to racial and ethnic minorities. Last week, when Ryan referred to the GOP as the party “of Jack Kemp,” he was saying Trump must adhere to the party’s tradition of  . How strong that tradition actually is in the modern GOP is a matter for historians. But by mentioning Kemp, and by insisting that the Republican presidential nominee “appeal to a wide, vast majority of Americans,” Americans from “every walk of life, every background,” Ryan was signaling that Trump must end his demonization of vulnerable minority groups. He must stop calling undocumented Mexican immigrants criminals. He must stop encouraging his supporters to assault African American protesters. He must stop calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Maybe Ryan will quietly convince Trump to move in that direction. Maybe Trump will decide that, in a general election, it’s politically advantageous to do so. But in today’s press conference, Ryan’s   language was strikingly absent. He didn’t mention Kemp. He didn’t insist that Trump appeal to a broad   of Americans. When he mentioned Republican principles, he talked about “the Constitution, the separation of powers,” “limited government,” and “life. ” He didn’t talk about treating all Americans equally and with respect. Especially given Ryan’s reference to the issue of abortion, which he mentioned twice, the Speaker could be signaling that if Trump offers robust assurances that he will appoint conservatives to the bench, that will constitute unity enough.   inclusion be damned. Give Ryan credit. He still hasn’t endorsed Trump, even though, politically, that would have been the safer   move. But over the last week, as Sean Hannity has suggested that Ryan be dumped as speaker and Sarah Palin has declared her support for his primary challenger, the risks Ryan is courting by taking an     have become clear. The House Speaker is a decent man whose vision of conservatism is clearly very different than Trump’s. But he’s not a writer at National Review. He’s an ambitious Republican politician who saw what happened to Marco Rubio, another    darling of the GOP elite who incurred the wrath of the nationalist right. And so, in his press conference today, by abandoning the rhetorical framework he outlined last week, Ryan began the process of surrender.                 Like this?

2016-05-13,"Almost no one saw Donald Trump coming a year ago, it seems. And there’s all sorts of   as to why: Journalists blew it. Or maybe it was political scientists’ fault. But there’s one big reason why so many smart people overlooked him: He’s the opposite of what many of the loudest voices in the Republican Party said they wanted. Last year, GOP pollster Whit Ayres famously laid out what the party would need to win the White House in 2016 and Beyond. In particular, Ayres’   book focused on the nation’s demographics, insisting that the party had to win over nonwhites, and particularly Hispanics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his conclusions in several ways mirrored what the GOP laid out in its 2013 ”autopsy”: The party needed to change with a changing America, reaching out in particular to minorities, young people and women. (It’s one reason Ayres eventually backed Marco Rubio  —   for his potential for broader appeal.) The candidate the GOP is nominating doesn’t meet those criteria. In fact, he underperforms among all of those groups. But while Beltway insiders crafted their recommendations, more than 10 million primary voters doused those recommendations in lighter fluid, threw a match and walked away in slow motion, with Carmina Burana playing in the background. So we decided to see how far off the voters were from the GOP insiders. Fortunately, Ayres created the easiest way to count this up  —   an   checklist. Here’s what he thought a successful presidential candidate would need in 2016, based on what he saw as the party’s weaknesses after 2012 and the nation’s changing demographics: NPR scored the final three (Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Trump) plus a couple of this cycle’s former strong contenders (Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio) as well as two dark horses whose names popped up during the nominating fight (Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney). (We also attempted to score two other dark horses who occasionally were mentioned as candidates  —   Condoleezza Rice and Nikki Haley  —   but given their lack of   polling data and stated policy positions in some areas, we ended up with too many blanks.) Using a simple scoring system involving polls and expert opinions, we tried to answer each of these questions for each selected candidate, except No. 7 (gaming out which of these people could hypothetically win swing states is just too hard to do reliably). On each one, the candidates received a score between   and 1. Here are their scores: (For an explanation of how we did this, scroll down to the ”Methodology” section.) It’s a rough calculation, but there are a few important takeaways here: 1) The candidates who scored the worst also did best in the primaries. Trump and, to a lesser extent, Cruz failed to meet the criteria Ayres (and, in many cases, the GOP) thought a successful   candidate would need in 2016. Meanwhile, Ryan, who didn’t even run, does by far the best, scoring a total of 3 points. He’s followed closely by John Kasich, at 1. 75 points, who won only his home state. (One caveat here is that Ryan hasn’t sustained the negative attacks that this year’s GOP contenders have  —   which could bring down his poll numbers. But at the very least, even had Ryan somehow performed poorly among all three groups in this analysis, he still would have beat Cruz and Trump here.) To be clear, none of this is to say that the GOP primary voters were wrong. They picked who they wanted. But their ideas of what they wanted were very different from the party’s, for better or worse, from the party’s point of view (more on that later). 2) These criteria were just a baseline. Rubio did relatively well here. And he also flamed out after Chris Christie embarrassed him at a February debate, calling out Rubio’s constant repetition of one particular talking point. After that, Rubio drew still more criticism for joking about the size of Donald Trump’s, er, hands. The point is that someone could have performed well here and still have had big problems as a candidate. Despite barrels of superPAC money, Bush excited very few voters. Despite being a     governor, Kasich never really caught fire. The point is that the ability to connect with voters is a necessary  —   maybe the most necessary (and unspoken)  —   item on any   checklist. And this year, that may have meant this checklist was incomplete, as voters also seemed to demand a candidate who openly, actively despised the Washington establishment. 3) There’s a difference between the primaries and the general election. To reiterate, this is a general election checklist, as Ayres framed it. This is what he thought the party would need to appeal to a wider swath of voters than GOP primary voters. Unfortunately for the GOP, the two are at odds. Winning more women, Hispanics and young voters, everyone seemed to agree, was necessary to beating whomever the Democrats might nominate. But those aren’t exactly the keys to winning the GOP nomination fight. The primary electorate, for example, is almost entirely white. Any presidential candidate has to win first the one group, then the other. The GOP’s problem right now is that while winning the nomination, its de facto candidate staked out positions (deporting 11 million immigrants, punishing women for getting abortions) that could scare off those constituencies the party thinks it needs. 4) Establishment, meet actual voters. Voters, meet establishment. Maybe the clearest,      message here: The GOP establishment and primary electorate were fantastically disconnected from one another. The party took a cold,   look at its failings after 2008 and 2012, then looked over the nation’s demographics, and put two and two together: Something needed to change. Strategists decided they needed to rethink their outreach and, to an extent, change their very policies in order to appeal to a   (and, they feared, steadily slipping away) electorate. The problem is that many Republican voters, distrustful of all things Beltway and increasingly hostile toward Democrats, didn’t want (or believe) cold and  . Their final two candidates, Trump and Cruz, also scored the worst on these criteria. It’s not that Republicans’ recommendations were grounded in fantasy. Demographics are changing. The party would do well to move further beyond older, white voters. And given all that, there is another intriguing possibility here: 4. 5) The GOP establishment may have been right on emphasis, wrong on execution. The establishment seemed to think the party needed a softer, more approachable face in 2016. Consider the GOP’s giant subhead in its autopsy: ”Some people say, ’Republicans Don’t Care,’ ” or Ayres’ call for a ”positive” candidate whose attitude offered ”more grace, less condemnation.” Trump doesn’t project a warm, fuzzy, caring persona. But there is more than one way to show voters you care. One  —   the one that the GOP and Ayres appear to have been talking about  —   is perhaps best exemplified in Kasich’s Ohio victory speech: ”We are leaving no one behind, not the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor.” Trump picked a different way to show that he cared: He got pissed off. So for all his bluster, voters just might see empathy in Donald Trump: ”I am very angry because our country is being run horribly, and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger,” he said. It’s a tactic that didn’t pop up in many   analyses, but it sure has worked.  —   —   METHODOLOGY, All categories are scored on a scale of   to 1. 1: ”Positive, hopeful, and optimistic” 7: Can unite the GOP, Four top conservative strategists and pollsters scored the candidates with a 1, 2 or 3 (which we later converted to   0, or 1) on whether the candidates are ”positive, hopeful, and optimistic” (question 1) as well as whether the candidates could ”unite the various factions of the Republican coalition” (question 8). Our loose definitions we set up:   means awful, 0 means   and 1 means excellent. We then averaged the scores together. 2: Has held office, We simply gave candidates a   or a 1 on this one: 1 for having held office,   for not. 3: Offers a ”specific and persuasive agenda” for the middle class, Four top economists and economic experts from   organizations weighed in on whether the real and hypothetical candidates had a ”specific and persuasive agenda to appeal to the economic anxieties of the middle class.” Again, the scores were 1 to 3, which we later made   0 or 1. We then averaged the scores together. 4. Appeals to Hispanics and other minority voters, For any candidate who ran for president in 2016, we looked at their recent net favorability ratings among nonwhites before they dropped out (or, in Trump’s case, recent ratings, period). For Cruz, Kasich, Ryan and Trump, we used data from a recent national poll (an   poll of registered voters from April). We also used a February   poll to get numbers on Rubio and Bush. For Romney, we looked at his favorability rating among nonwhites according to a   Quinnipiac poll from April 2012  —   not a perfect comparison, but we were only looking for direction of favorability among registered voters from a similar time period in the last cycle. Substantially negative (  negative) favorability gave a candidate a score of  . Substantially ( ) positive gave a candidate a score of 1. Anything around 0 was a score of 0. 5. Appeals to   white voters, In these cases, we used the same polls as above for everyone, looking at the favorability figures for white people without a college degree. Substantially negative (  negative) favorability gave a candidate a score of  . Substantially ( ) positive gave a candidate a score of 1. Anything around 0 was a score of 0. 6. Appeals to young people, As with No. 4, we looked at the aforementioned polls for candidates’ favorability ratings among young voters (  to   ). Substantially negative ratings gave a candidate a score of  . Substantially positive gave a candidate a score of 1. Anything around 0 was a score of 0."
2016-05-14,"Voters yet to make up their minds on the European Union (EU) referendum question are twice as likely to cite immigration as their main concern than the economy, a poll has found. The results could explain why the Leave campaign has been gaining momentum in recent days. [According to a Sky News poll, of the 29 percent of Brits who are still undecided on the issue, 28 percent are most concerned about the impact the EU has on immigration levels, whereas just 15 percent cite the economy as their biggest concern.  The results are good news for Leave campaigners who have been focussing on making the public aware of the leading role the European Union has played in driving immigration to Britain into the hundreds of thousands a year, while hampering the British government’s ability to reverse that trend. The Remain campaign, meanwhile, has been relying on establishment figures in the banking industry to warn of economic doom should the British people dare to opt to leave the Union at the referendum on 23 June. An intervention by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, in which he warned of recession, inflation, a “sharp” crash in the value of Stirling, lower wages and rising house prices in the event of Brexit led one independent analyst to comment “It was as if George Osborne had written the script. ” The Leave campaign has been gaining momentum steadily over the last four weeks, rising from being eight points behind in   April to a dead heat on 50 percent apiece in the current poll of polls. Based on Sky’s results, the events of this week could see Leave pull ahead for the first time thanks to the Office of National Statistics’ admission that it has underestimated European migration by 1. 5 million people. Responding to that figure, Conservative Employment Minister Priti Patel said: “These figures  —   which had to be dragged out of the government  —   show the scale and impact of immigration from the EU is even higher than previously admitted. “It is out of control  —   and cannot be controlled as long as we stay in the EU. “The only way we can take back control, and deliver on our manifesto commitment to reduce migration is to Vote Leave on 23 June. ” Even more damningly, the former Tory leader Iain   has revealed that Germany, not the Prime Minister David Cameron, led the way during Mr Cameron’s renegotiation talks, designed to secure a better deal on EU membership for the UK. They even went so far as to block migration control proposals. “The Germans said from the outset, you are not getting border control. Full stop,” he said. “They have had a de facto veto over everything. ”"
2016-05-15,"Harry Truman had been vice president for only 82 days when Franklin Roosevelt died, so there was quite a lot he needed to learn when he became president in 1945. ”He didn’t even know the atomic bomb existed,” historian David Priess said. ”He didn’t know about the Manhattan Project.” Priess, a former CIA officer and author of The President’s Book of Secrets, a history of the president’s daily brief, said that experience made Truman resolve that no future president should come into office unprepared. So in 1952, as the world grew accustomed to nuclear peril and other threats in the unfolding Cold War, Truman offered classified briefings about the global security situation to each of the   nominees running to replace him. That tradition has held up ever since. Traditionally, the White House waits until Republicans and Democrats have formally nominated their candidates at their party conventions, Priess said, but not always. Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter had no experience with foreign intelligence, so he asked President Gerald Ford for his briefings before he was nominated  —   and got them. ”Ultimately, it’s the president’s call,” Priess said, about who is briefed and when. Although presidents typically try to accommodate candidates, even ones in the opposite party, they do not share everything. So, as the White House prepares to arrange briefings by the intelligence community, officials will likely hold back sensitive details about covert operations, secret nuclear and other defense programs, and other such details. In fact, intelligence briefers this year may need to be more careful than ever, said former CIA analyst Aki Peritz. The de facto Republican nominee, Donald Trump, is ”a man famously with no filter,” Peritz said of Trump, who has built his campaign upon what he calls straight talk. ”He’s never held public office before,” Peritz said. ”He’s a business developer and a reality TV star. So if the United States starts giving Donald Trump classified briefings” with certain kinds of sensitive information, ”it could be a disaster.” And Democratic   Hillary Clinton has had her own problems with allegations that she’s been careless with classified information. Clinton ran her own private email server as secretary of state and has been accused of imperiling the security of her office and the correspondence she kept with top leaders around Washington. Clinton denies she did anything wrong under the rules in effect at the time. As for resuming her access to classified material in the candidate briefings she and Trump will receive, the details aren’t yet clear. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told reporters at a recent breakfast that the   briefings would take place at a secure facility, whenever the candidates request. He was pressed about how his office would be sure the information in its presentations would stay secure. The process is set up ”to ensure that everybody gets the same information,” Clapper said, ”and that we do comply with the need to protect sources and methods and comply with security rules.” EDITOR’S NOTE: This story was reported by Mary Louise Kelly and edited by Philip Ewing"
2016-05-16,"TEL AVIV  —   Temperatures in Israel reached a scorching 47ºC (116. 6 ºF) over the weekend, resulting in over 450 people being treated by paramedics and brush fires sweeping the country. [The extreme and unusual weather generated a dramatic increase in the number of calls to Israel’s emergency services MDA. MDA has been handing out stickers to remind drivers not to leave children (or pets) in locked vehicles even for a moment.  Fire and rescue services were called out to eliminate two large brush fires in forested areas and several smaller ones elsewhere in the country. The heatwave, known locally as sharav in Hebrew or hamtzin in Arabic, drew strong winds from the north all the way along the coast later. Forecasters said that by Tuesday the heat is predicted to break, and a further drop is expected on Wednesday. The blistering temperatures could set new records for the month of May. The record for May in Eilat was recorded on May 31, 1980, at 45. 2ºC (113. 36ºF)  —   a number that has already been surpassed. Meteorologist Dr. Baruch Ziv explained that the current heat wave is considered a “subsidence heat wave. It’s caused by the sinking of higher air levels, which is a slow process when the area has a high pressure system, which is  . It takes time, and it cooks, quite literally, for a few days. Actually, on Independence Day, we were in its initial stages, but in most parts of the country, it wasn’t felt. And since then, it’s only gotten hotter. “The temperatures in Israel’s hot season rose by two degrees over 40 years. Our climate is already changing, and it’s going to change further. Coping with it is done by air conditioning, and as a result, there’s a rise in electricity demand, and the implication is that the Earth gets warmer,” he added. The electricity demand in Israel reached its peak on Sunday at 3:26pm with 11, 349 MW used, Ynet news reported. The previous peak demand for the month of May was last year at 11, 332 MW. The Israel Electric Corporation has postponed disconnecting customers who have not paid their electricity bills until the end of the current heat wave."
2016-05-17,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. May 17 marks the 62nd anniversary of the U. S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision, which outlawed deliberately placing black and white students in separate schools. The ruling was designed so that school districts could come up with plans for desegregating their own educational facilities, but six decades later, school segregation remains a problem. A new U. S. Government Accountability Office report found that the number of schools with at least 75 percent black, Latino, or poor students grew from 9 percent to 16 percent over the last 15 years across the country. One city that just never succeeded at school integration is Cleveland, Mississippi, where the school district was sued by a group of parents way back in 1965 for its failure to comply with Brown. Black families were concentrated (both then and today) in neighborhoods to the east of a railroad track that split Cleveland in half, both physically and racially. Black children were forbidden from attending schools located to the west of the tracks, where white families lived almost exclusively, due to Jim Crow policies. This sequestering of black students persisted for decades after that lawsuit was filed, despite numerous consent decrees and court orders for the Cleveland school district to desegregate. The district was never able to come up with a plan that could convince white parents to send their kids to schools on the black side of town. Now, the federal government wants Cleveland to squash its schools’   reputations by folding the     black middle and high schools into the historically white schools to create single, blended schools for each age group. On May 13, a federal judge agreed to this plan despite considerable opposition from school and city officials, who insist on keeping the schools bifurcated. This, more than 60 years after the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that “  ” schools were unconstitutional. Wrote U. S. District Court Judge Debra M. Brown in her ruling:   …     In the decades since this pronouncement, the District has failed to meet this obligation as it concerns the high schools and middle schools in Cleveland, Mississippi. This failure, whether born of good faith, bad faith, or some combination of the two, has placed Cleveland in the unenviable position of operating under a desegregation order long after schools in bastions of segregation like Boston, Jackson, and Mobile have been declared unitary. Moreimportant, and of far greater harm, the delay in desegregation has deprived generations of students of the   right of an integrated education. Although no court order can right these wrongs, it is the duty of the District to ensure that not one more student suffers under this burden. The order applies to two middle schools, including D. M. Smith, which is located east of the tracks and has maintained a 99 percent black student population since at least 2012. It also applies to the city’s two high schools —  including East Side High School, named for its location, and which has also maintained a 99 percent black student population over the past few years. The other two   schools, Margaret Green Middle School and Cleveland High School, were originally predominantly white schools, but today maintain a somewhat even racial split (though white student enrollment has been declining in both). Those schools have been able to achieve better integration results by adding a mix of magnet and   programs, all features of prior   desegregation plans and consent decrees. It’s not that those programs didn’t work, it’s that they worked in just one direction. Meaning, they enabled black students to integrate into the white   schools, but were ineffective in integrating white students into the predominantly black schools. Meanwhile, those   “black” schools earned reputations for inferior accommodations. Sharon Lerner offered some details on these facilities in an article that ran in The Atlantic last year, for which she interviewed Mauve Sanders, a   Side High student whose family is a plaintiff in the court case Judge Brown just decided. Wrote Lerner: East Side students didn’t even get science textbooks to bring home at night there aren’t enough to go around. They don’t have lockers, either. Sanders and his classmates carry their books around in their backpacks all day. Though he is a strong and athletic, ”it gets heavy,” says Sanders. A mile away, students at the racially mixed Cleveland High have these basics, even though the school receives more than $3, 000 less per student each year than East Side does, according to the school district. And Cleveland has some amenities East Side does not, including a softball field and a weight room ”that makes ours look like a baby weight room,” as Sanders puts it. An investigator hired by the Justice Department in 2009 found that the quality of Cleveland’s   —  or mostly black —  schools was ”not comparable to [the quality at] those with majority white enrollments,” noting lighting that failed to meet minimum standards and buildings that were of ”substantially poorer quality.” Cleveland’s two high schools do literally sit a mile from each other, on either side of the railroad track. Collectively, they hold about a thousand students, which isn’t enough to overburden the high school system if combined into one, argued the Justice Department in its case against Cleveland. However, city leaders testified that “people in Cleveland are nervous, fearful, and resentful,” about the consolidation plan.   Boston University professor Christine Rossell, an expert on desegregation, testified on Cleveland’s behalf that if the schools consolidated, it would trigger “white flight. ” It’s a perspective that closely resembles the position of many Cleveland parents, mainly white, who’ve resisted for decades any proposal that would have them place their children in predominantly black schools. But the 1987 United States v. Pittman ruling declared that white flight threats cannot be considered when creating desegregation plans, and Judge Brown ruled accordingly: The Court suspects that white enrollment loss related to consolidation, like most things, will fall somewhere between the two extremes. The District is likely to suffer some white enrollment loss as a result of consolidation. While this is a concern, it is insufficient, in the absence of an alternative constitutional plan, to reject consolidation. Rather, potential white enrollment loss is a problem that must be met with creativity. To this end, the U. S. Plan calls for a rebranding effort, a diverse offering of academic programs, and the formation of a   advisory panel to ease the transition —  all methods this Court finds reasonable and appropriate. Vanderbilt University professor Clare Smrekar, also an expert on desegregation, testified on the Justice Department’s behalf that the white flight concerns are overblown. Said Smrekar in her testimony: [A]fter careful analysis, after reviewing all the documents, after spending almost a year thinking about this and spending time in this community, it is my conclusion that a    model is the most effective, will achieve desegregation realistically and immediately. I believe it will draw students and maintain diversity in this community because it offers what the families demanded. The Cleveland School District, for its part, argued that it could achieve full integration by installing more magnet programs in the predominantly black schools to lure more white families. But they’ve been doing that for almost half a century —  in ways that seem to have, at best, only benefitted the white schools on the west side of town. Which is why the judge ruled continuing those strategies unconstitutional. Judge Brown recognized in her order the city’s previous, failed desegregation plans, acknowledging that they were made with good intentions. However, as Brown wrote in her ruling, “good intentions cannot render the proposed unconstitutional plans constitutional. ”After all of those decades of failure, the best way to move forward is to try something never before attempted: In order to integrate, Cleveland will need to disintegrate the   and   features that have pushed black students into separate, substandard learning facilities. No more schools associated with being on the right or wrong side of the railroad tracks —  just one, unified school, with students and teachers of every race, all on the same side. The erasure of the dividing line of the city has already begun, with the railroad track now turned into a bike trail. As Reverend Edward Duvall, a parent of Cleveland students, testified, “We can break down this wall of racism that divides us and keeps us separated, and we could create a new culture in our school system that’s going to unite us and unite our whole city. ” This article appears courtesy of CityLab."
2016-05-18,"Sen. Rand Paul ( ) told Breitbart News exclusively on Tuesday that most American companies would not take the risk of hiring former President Bill Clinton in the wake of sexual assault and rape allegations from a litany of women including Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey, and more. [“I think most company policies in most American corporations wouldn’t even hire someone like Bill Clinton because of his threat to the young people in the workplace,” Paul told Breitbart News in the exclusive phone interview. “As CEO in any company in America, his behavior with an intern would be so unacceptable that he’s really not someone that any company in America would hire. ”  Paul also said that the Clintons —  as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Bill’s husband, seeks to ascend to the presidency —  must answer these questions and must answer them in a straightforward manner. Paul argued that the woman should be believed when it comes to allegations of rape and sexual assault, and that no exception should be made for Bill Clinton. “I think it is important,” Paul said. “Probably one of the most poignant questions that was addressed to Hillary Clinton was, ‘Hillary Clinton: When a woman says that she has been raped, or a woman says that she has been taken advantage of, should we believe her?’ The question that was asked of her was ‘Should we believe women when they report that someone has harassed her?’ That’s what Hillary Clinton said, is you should, and a person in the audience said ‘well, what about Bill?’ And she refused to answer the question, and I think that’s unacceptable. There’s been a lot of accusations. Should we believe the accuser, or should we take Bill Clinton’s word for it?”  A spokesman for the Clinton campaign has not responded to a request for comment at this time. The Clintons have largely aimed to avoid answering when pressed on this matter, but at this time presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is pushing the issue extraordinarily hard. In an interview on Sean Hannity’s program on Wednesday night, Trump is expected to use the term “rape” with regards to Bill Clinton for the first time. Trump has promised he will push the Clintons on these questions throughout the course of the election. Meanwhile, Paul, one of Trump’s former competitors in the 2016 GOP primary, backed his candidacy in the first part of this Breitbart News exclusive interview on Tuesday. Paul said that now that Trump is the GOP’s presidential candidate, he intends to support the pledge he made to back the nominee. Paul just won   as the GOP nominee for U. S. Senate in Kentucky and is expected to easily defeat his   Democratic opponent in November’s general election in the   coal mining state. More from Paul’s exclusive interview with Breitbart News —  including much more about the Clintons —  is forthcoming."
2016-05-19,"The controversial protest group “Concerned Student 1950” may have been permitted by University of Missouri administrators to break a   policy against certain forms of protest on campus. [According to the University of Missouri System’s Collected Rules and Regulations, “no University building, or part thereof, or grounds may be occupied as living rooms or bedroom except those duly set aside for such purposes. ” According to The Kansas City Star, this policy was enacted in 1949 to ensure that students slept indoors in safe conditions.  Despite this rule, University of Missouri Police Chief Doug Schwandt claims that campus administrators granted protesters special permission to camp on one of the campus’ main quads. One of the students who led the protests, Jonathan Butler, has received significant attention for his activism at the University of Missouri. He embarked on a speaking tour with celebrity talent booker All American Speakers and has spoken at the law schools of Duke and Harvard. However, he has recently come under fire after it was revealed that “he’s chronically stolen items, denigrated   workers, and made troubling comments about women and drugs. ” Butler, who is considered to be a prominent voice in the national conversation about the   struggle, is the son of a railroad executive who earns an annual salary of $8. 4 million, according to regulatory filings. In 2015, the protests orchestrated by Butler and the other students who comprised “Concerned Student 1950” culminated with the resignations of University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe and University Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. One of the main reasons for Wolfe’s resignation was a hunger strike conducted by Butler.

2016-05-20,"People who run successful businesses, like the people they employ and empower, often invest some of their success in the pursuit of good causes. To this end, major companies donate billions of dollars every year to fund a wide variety of nonprofit organizations dedicated to everything from feeding the homeless and educating underprivileged youth to encouraging environmental stewardship or a particular policy point of view. But as the saying goes, the road to hell is well paved with good intentions. This is  . Successful businesses certainly engage employee concerns and strive to sustain a welcoming environment. More companies should. But at some point, business leaders must weigh public and consumer desire against the ebbs and flows of internal sentiments. In spite of the political views of a corporation’s leadership or its employees, it is incumbent on public companies to acknowledge the belief systems and opposing perspectives of other groups. Today, the same argument is prominent in political battles across the states. When employees’ political agendas impede the employer’s ability to be successful or profitable, there will be negative consequences for the company. A case in point: Shell publicly severed ties with a network of   state lawmakers, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) to appease   climate extremists. The company was faced with a heated campaign organized by the same forces that opposed the Obama administration’s approval of Shell’s bid to drill for oil and natural gas in the Arctic. Amid the politically motivated regulatory mess, Shell swiftly abandoned the   drilling project, only months after loudly championing it. Put simply, Shell surrendered two valuable assets to   hecklers  —   its participation in a large, effective network of powerful legislators and $7 billion in its prized Arctic drilling project. Meanwhile, the Shell Foundation spends millions on solar and other   projects favored by the same activists who willfully undermine its business success in the name of, among other things, renewable energy. Of course, it is the height of hypocrisy to embrace corporate funding and then attack those corporate donors for investing in the successful practices that gave them the means to donate in the first place. More important, this ongoing dynamic shows the degree to which businesses have willfully catered to the far Left in hopes of being loved, only to find their generosity transformed into their own weakness. For industry leaders, donating to progressive organizations in the hope of earning good will is like paying ransom to blackmailers in the hope they will be satisfied and stop. Progressive agitators will never be satisfied, and the more support they get, the more they will use it against their misguided supporters. Instead of pandering to groups that will never love or respect them, industry leaders should embrace networks and ideas that encourage the healthy economic growth vital to everybody’s success. General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt understood this well when he stood up to U. S. senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders to defend free enterprise for the incredible good it has done for hardworking American taxpayers. The people who create jobs for hardworking Americans should never apologize for success or enable the bad actors who would undermine it. If industry leaders want to keep succeeding, they should encourage a culture and society that values entrepreneurship, education, and success. If some progressives are loudly unhappy about that, so be it.  —   Lisa B. Nelson is the CEO of the American Legislative Exchange Council. To learn more about ALEC, visit www. alec. org.  "
2016-05-21,"Exaggerator has taken home the second gem in horse racing’s triple crown. The colt won a   Preakness Stakes on Saturday, handing rival Nyquist the first loss of his career and ending his shot at a triple crown. It wasn’t an easy win for Exaggerator, though. For much of the race, the colt trailed not only Nyquist but Uncle Lino, as well. As in the Kentucky Derby two weeks ago, Exaggerator mounted a   bid to take the lead unlike that last race, however, Exaggerator finished the job. Nyquist entered the race as the favorite, with   odds, trailed by Stradivari and Exaggerator, whom he narrowly defeated at Churchill Downs two weeks ago. Nyquist  —   who’s named for the NHL’s Gustav Nyquist by his hockey fan owner  —   has now gone 8 for 9 in major races. Rain came down for much of the day at Pimlico Race Course, just outside Baltimore. Still, Nyquist’s trainer, Dale Romans, betrayed no concern for the conditions in the   to the race. ”My horse loves the mud,” Romans quipped to AL. com. Yet it was Exaggerator  —   and his jockey, Kent Desormeaux  —   who emerged from the muck with the win. Now, speculation surrounding a possible triple crown is also effectively silenced. With wins split between Nyquist and Exaggerator in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, respectively, American Pharoah remains assured of his status as the only horse to win a triple crown since 1978. The thoroughbred managed that achievement last year. Next up on the schedule: the Belmont Stakes, which will be run on June 11. Deaths In The Undercards, Dark notes sounded at the   track earlier in the day, however. Two horses died within the first four undercard races at Pimlico, including one of the victors. Homeboykris, a    underdog gelding, won the day’s first race at long odds  —   but collapsed shortly after leaving the winner’s circle. Officials don’t yet know the horse’s cause of death, but his trainer, Francis Campitelli, told The Baltimore Sun he suspects it was a heart attack. ”They’re thinking at this point it was some sort of heart attack  —   you know, ruptured aorta or something like that,” Campitelli said of the horse, which had a long racing career behind him. He had finished 16th in the 2010 Kentucky Derby. ”We won’t know until they do a necropsy on him, just to find out exactly what happened.” Not long after that, Pramedya, a    filly, fractured her leg during the fourth race. The horse’s jockey, Daniel Centeno, also broke his clavicle in the accident. The horse was euthanized on the track. It’s not the first tragedy for Pramedya’s owner. The Washington Post reports that Lael Stables also owned Barbaro, a former Kentucky Derby winner ”who broke his right hind leg racing in the 2006 Preakness and died from complications from the injury in January of 2007.”"
2016-05-22,"   Chung Min Lee is a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul and a   senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He is the author of the new book “Fault Lines in a Rising Asia. ”       Riding the crest of seemingly unstoppable growth, Asia’s rise has captured the popular imagination for three decades. By most   measures, such as gross domestic product, trade volumes, technological prowess and military capabilities, Asia has emerged as the world’s third pillar, along with the United States and Europe. Indeed, many commentators have argued that the 21st century will not only be dominated by key Asian states such as China, India and Japan, and major middle powers including South Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia, but also that the region as a whole is on its way to eclipsing the West. But as President Obama embarks on a highly symbolic trip to Asia, it’s timely to point out that such linear conceptions of Asia’s inexorable rise are misleading and incomplete, given the magnitude of political, security and socioeconomic problems confronting Greater Asia. With the Asian economic juggernaut coming to an end, due to lower growth in China, an aging Japan and South Korea, and India’s ongoing problems with corruption and a bureaucracy that impedes structural reform, the continent must be viewed from another angle: as a department store of many of the world’s gargantuan political and military challenges. Indeed, unless Asia’s strategically consequential states can significantly mitigate, if not resolve, the region’s political and military deficits, Asia’s rise will never be completed.  Today, the Asian continent confronts two major challenges. The first lies in the   consequences of Asia’s de facto arms race. According to figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the United States continues to lead the world in annual defense spending, at $596 billion, but the combined defense outlays of China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan and Singapore reached $334 billion in 2015. The institute data also show that from 2010 to 2014, nine of the top 20 arms importers were Asian states. China seeks to contest the U. S. military in the western Pacific in order to project power into the   first and second island chains by the 2020s, and its aggressive moves recently in the South China Sea demonstrate its determination. And beyond this, the continent is home to three major geopolitical flash points: the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea could conduct a fifth nuclear test; the Taiwan Strait; and the   nuclear competition in South Asia.  Asia’s de facto arms race creates deeper and wider security dilemmas and a constant, destabilizing introduction of more lethal, more accurate and   weapons systems. If this military competition isn’t worrisome enough, the region is also burdened by unparalleled political quagmires. In 2021, the Chinese Communist Party will celebrate its 100th anniversary and the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. China has made enormous economic strides since reforms began in 1978, and the Communist Party should be proud of its achievements. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage the world’s   economy via ironclad   rule. As the party continues to crack down on dissent and the free flow of information, while also issuing edicts on empowered nationalism, stopping “spiritual contamination” and resisting foreign intrusions, China will be characterized by progressively harsh surveillance and internal policing. The party’s biggest threat doesn’t arise from the United States or Japan; it comes from the hundreds of millions of educated, globalized and economically   citizens who will demand increasingly great liberties and accountability from their government. “Performance legitimacy”  —   the   of popular political support for sustained economic growth despite constrained political freedoms  —   no longer works as China’s social contract.  Asia’s political landscape is replete with other dangers, too, including the failed state of North Korea, with its nuclear weapons and increasing ballistic missile capabilities. Pakistan, also a virtually failed state, faces unprecedented socioeconomic challenges while being run by the army despite a facade of civilian rule, all while locked in a nuclear arms race with archrival India. Burma is transitioning to a   system, but the army refuses to fully surrender power. In Southeast Asia, democracy has regressed in Thailand, while Malaysia’s government is embroiled in a major corruption scandal. For all these reasons, the vast majority of Asian states feel much more comfortable with the United States rather than China as the indispensable power in maintaining regional stability and prosperity. There is no doubt that Asia has made enormous progress over the past   but it’s time to wake up to the continent’s political, security and strategic quagmires. It is undeniably true that the liberal international order long led and maintained by the United States and the rest of the West faces problems. But attempts to blame the West for Asia’s problems today are intellectually shallow and politically expedient. Asia must undertake wrenching political reforms, including the embracing and strengthening of universal values, for an Asian century to truly dawn. Asia has risen, but it is far from reigning.

2016-05-23,"   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Iraqi government forces, backed by U. S. and coalition airstrikes, have launched a military offensive to recapture Fallujah from Islamic State militants who overran the Iraqi city more than two years ago. The battle for the city, located east of Baghdad, began overnight Sunday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi said in a televised announcement. The offensive includes Iraqi troops, police, and Shia militias. Reuters reporters in Baghdad described the fight on Monday: Some of the first direct clashes occurred in the area of   on Falluja’s southern outskirts, a resident said. Iraqi troops also approached the northern suburb of Garma, the top municipal official there said, to clear out militants before turning their attention toward the city center. Air strikes and mortar salvoes overnight targeted neighborhoods inside the city where Islamic State is believed to maintain its headquarters. The bombardment had eased by daybreak. Seven civilians and two militants were killed in the shelling, while 21 civilians and two militants were wounded, a source at Falluja’s medical center said. The number of fatalities is expected to rise. No casualties among Iraqi troops were reported Monday, according to Reuters. Fallujah was the first of several cities in Iraq to fall to ISIS in 2014. The Islamist militant group has controlled the city since January of that year. That summer, the group declared a caliphate covering large parts of Iraq and Syria. In December 2015, Iraqi troops and the U. S.  coalition regained control of Ramadi, the Iraqi city that had been under ISIS control for about six months. U. S. and Iraqi officials hope next to attempt to retake Mosul, a city north of Fallujah. ISIS took control of Mosul in June 2014. In the early aughts, Fallujah served as a stronghold for the Iraqi branch of  . In 2004, 100 American troops were killed and 600 were injured in Fallujah in a   battle against   insurgents during in the Iraq war."
2016-05-24,"A judge in Pennsylvania ruled Tuesday that there is sufficient evidence for a sexual assault case against comedian Bill Cosby to move to trial. The arraignment is set for July, Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports. Cosby, who has been accused by dozens of women of sexual assault, has been charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault in the case, which involves a former Temple University employee who says Cosby assaulted her in his home in 2004. Each count carries five to 10 years in prison. The accuser, Andrea Constand, did not appear in court, but parts of a statement she gave in 2005 were read during Tuesday’s preliminary hearing in Norristown, Pa. The statement ”said that Constand felt dizzy, had blurred vision . .. after Cosby allegedly gave her pills she thought were herbal medicine,” Allyn reports. Cosby says the pills were Benadryl and the sexual contact was consensual. Cosby’s lawyer had argued that reading the statement was hearsay and that the defense should have a right to   the accuser, Allyn says. The judge rejected that argument, though, and said Cosby’s legal team would be able to do so at trial. Cosby, 78, appeared in court but did not speak, other than to say thank you when Magisterial District Judge Elizabeth McHugh wished him good luck following her ruling. Cosby’s defense attorneys had been trying get the charges tossed out since his arrest in December. In 2005, as the   has reported, a Montgomery County prosecutor decided there wasn’t enough evidence to bring charges in the case. The parties settled in 2006. New evidence, including a deposition given by Cosby, were enough to move the case forward in Pennsylvania this year. The Associated Press notes that Cosby is also ”fighting defamation lawsuits across the country for allegedly branding his accusers liars.”"
2016-05-25,"So, you thought the Big Apple was an expensive place to live? While you need an average salary of $85, 205 to buy a home in the New York City metro area, you have to rake in at least $144, 196 to buy in the San Francisco area, according to a new report. The stats, compiled by mortgage information site   are formulated based on median home prices for the first quarter of 2016 in big cities like New York and their surrounding areas, as well as on   mortgage requirements. San Diego, where residents need to earn at least $104, 486 a year to afford monthly mortgage payments, and Los Angeles ($90, 180) also are more expensive than New York. The average American needs to earn just under $50, 000 to purchase a home in their area. One bit of good news for New Yorkers was home ownership became a little more affordable. The median price dipped to $381, 000 from $385, 000 last year in the metro area, which includes Long Island, Westchester, New Jersey and the Hudson River Valley. “That is encouraging for folks who are struggling to make ends meet,” said HSH’s Keith Gumbinger."
2016-05-26,"   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. The Connecticut Supreme Court reaffirmed Thursday its decision to abolish capital punishment last year, turning back a   effort by state prosecutors to revive the death penalty in the state. In an unsigned   opinion in Connecticut v. Peeler, the court applied without fanfare its earlier ruling in Santiago v. Connecticut, which eliminated the state’s remaining death sentences last year. Five of the court’s seven justices concurred in Thursday’s order. Connecticut took an unusual path to abolishing the death penalty. The state repealed its   statute in 2012, thereby eliminating it as an option in future trials. But legislators chose not to alter the sentences of 11 inmates already on death row, leaving the possibility that executions could still take place in the state some day. In August 2015, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled those inmates’ death sentences unconstitutional in a   decision in Santiago. The majority framed its reasoning around a broader attack on capital punishment’s flaws the dissenters condemned the ruling as a reflection of the majority’s moral sentiment toward the death penalty. Prosecutors asked the court to reverse that ruling in Peeler. Russell Peeler received two death sentences from a Bridgeport jury for murdering a mother and her    son in 1999, but the case had little to do with his crime or conviction. Instead, as the Hartford Courant noted, prosecutors took aim at Santiago: Prosecutors said in deciding the Santiago case, the court ”did not confine its analysis” to the actual claim raised —  whether enacting the 2012 law invalidated the death sentences of those sentenced before the law went into effect. The court made its ruling, prosecutors said, ”for reasons having little or nothing to do with” enactment of the 2012 law and ”erred in its ruling on lines of analysis and authorities the parties had not discussed.” Prosecutors also argued that the justices relied on ”flawed historical analysis” to justify their ”departure from   principles of law” and incorrectly determined that state residents prior to the 1818 constitution gave the high court the authority to act independently to invalidate a penalty. At oral arguments in January, some of the justices shared their discomfort with reversing their own decision so rapidly. Justice Flemming Norcott Jr. who voted with the majority in Santiago, had also retired since the ruling and been replaced by Justice Richard Robertson. “At a minimum, it looks awfully odd to have a case of this magnitude decided differently within months simply because the panel changes,” Justice Richard Palmer told the lawyers. “That’s really what would be happening here.” Thursday’s decision reduced Peeler’s sentence to life without parole. Connecticut is one of 19 states to have abolished capital punishment.   others retain   statutes, though only a handful of them carry out executions or regularly impose death sentences."
2016-05-27,"CAIRO  —   A French vessel that joined the search for the   arrived Friday in the crash area, as Egyptian officials said search teams in the Mediterranean have picked up a beacon believed to be from the doomed aircraft. According to Egyptian security officials, the French ship is carrying equipment that can find flight data and cockpit voice recorders  —   the   “black boxes. ” French officials could not be immediately reached to confirm the ship’s whereabouts. Meanwhile, the chief investigator in Egypt said search teams in the Mediterranean have picked up a beacon believed to be from EgyptAir Flight 804. Locating a beacon has narrowed the search to a   ( ) radius, said Ayman   stressing that this doesn’t mean the black boxes have been found, which he said requires highly sophisticated technology. The signal that was picked up came from one of the devices on the plane transmitting its location, said   who spoke to reporters Thursday. Eight days after the plane crashed off Egypt’s northern coast on a    flight, the cause of the tragedy still has not been determined. Ships and planes from Egypt, Greece, France, the United States and other nations have been searching the Mediterranean north of the Egyptian port of Alexandria for the jet’s voice and flight data recorders, as well as more bodies and parts of the aircraft. Small pieces of the wreckage and human remains have already been recovered, while the bulk of the plane and the bodies of the passengers are believed to be deep under the sea. A Cairo forensic team has received the human remains and is carrying out DNA tests to identify the victims. AP AP AP AP AP AP View Slideshow Egypt’s civil aviation minister Sherif Fathi has said he believes terrorism is a more likely explanation than equipment failure or some other catastrophic event. But no hard evidence has emerged on the cause, and no militant group has claimed to have downed the jet. Earlier, leaked flight data indicated a sensor detected smoke in a lavatory and a fault in two of the plane’s cockpit windows in the final moments of the flight. The French air accident investigation agency, the BEA, said in a statement that the Laplace ship left Thursday from Corsica for the zone of the crash, with two BEA investigators aboard. The Laplace is equipped with three detectors made by the Alseamar company designed to detect and localize signals from the flight recorders, believed to be about 3, 000 meters (3, 280 yards) underwater. France may also send an unmanned submarine and   retrieval equipment, the statement said. The BEA is involved in the search because the crashed plane was an Airbus, manufactured in France. Because of the difficulties in finding the black boxes, Egypt has contracted two foreign companies to help locate the flight data recorders of the plane. One of the companies is Alseamar, which has equipment aboard the French vessel. Egyptian officials have said the second company is called Deep Ocean Search. Also, Egyptian President     said earlier that a submarine would join the search for the plane’s data recorders. However,   told reporters that the submarine is not equipped to detect signals from the black boxes. All Egyptian officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information."
2016-05-28,"The voice on the other end of the line, doing what they call “intake” had one last question. “Do you have a preference in terms of the gender of your therapist?” I paused, a little thrown by the question. I was just mechanically following friends’ advice to seek help and take advantage of free therapy sessions provided by our graduate school the idea of having a choice had not crossed my mind. “No,” I replied, trying to avoid unnecessary fussiness. My therapist turned out to be a man, and he was brilliant. Through our sessions, I realized that his most important attributes were extreme perceptiveness and intelligence, as well as progressive politics (the books in his office made his interests clear). Without those, I realize, I would not have been able to feel comfortable enough to open up. What makes for a good fit when it comes to finding a therapist? Does a therapist have to be a certain way, or have lived through specific things, to “get it”? Do they need to mirror us? Dior Vargas, a    Latina mental health activist, recalls a therapist in college  —   her second one  —   who she stopped going to after realizing she was “culturally incompetent”. “She wasn’t aware of how   Latino families are. That they are a part of my   process. My therapist didn’t understand that, she would say: ‘No, you need to stand up to your mother.’ That felt very disrespectful to me. Maybe sometimes you do, but the way she said it made me very defensive. ” Vargas’s two positive experiences were with therapists with whom she felt she shared a piece of identity: one with a woman with the same Ecuadorian background as her, and another with a woman who was openly gay. “I identify as queer. I felt like I could trust her,” she says. When it comes to making therapy less monochrome a practice, Vargas says the problem does not just come from a preconception that only white people seek therapy, the problem also comes from the fact that therapists themselves tend to be overwhelmingly white. “The more diverse the workforce is in order to mirror the people they are working with, the easier it will be. I think it’s important to get what the lived experience of being an ‘other’ actually is like. ” Randolph   II, 29, who is himself a PhD student in clinical psychology, agrees there is a dearth of suitably diverse therapists to match clients’ needs. “I don’t typically have an option in terms of who I pick. It’s kind of, this is who I was referred to and then I see whether I can go with it,” he says. Ideally he would like to have a black male therapist from an   background from New York City  —   an identity that mirrors his. “It’s really hard  —   almost impossible  —   to find that. But if I had a choice, that’s who I would pick. ” In college, while experiencing racism in a way he had never been exposed to before, through intentional and extensive search aided by family and friends,   did manage to find an African American male therapist. It was his best experience yet, he says  —   and crucially one that influenced him to pursue a career in the field. “It felt like he understood the context that I was coming to him in. It informed the way he handled me as a case. He didn’t pathologize me,” he says. The fact that his therapist could share experiences of racism in predominantly white spaces with him was validating. In other situations, with therapists who lack the same background,   says he has felt “put in a box that doesn’t fit”: instead of being listened to, assumptions have been made. With one white female therapist, he says he felt his gender and race made her treat him like a threat that needed to be controlled. “She shut me down when I expressed anger. The response was you need to stop your anger, as opposed to “let’s work with that and figure out why you are angry,” which would have been a healthier therapeutic response, he says.    says he has been approached by acquaintances who are black and male who have expressed a wish to work with him once he has finished his training. These are men who would probably not seek therapy with someone who was not black and male, he says. But mirroring is not the necessary solution to encourage a more diverse and satisfied population in therapy. Ayorkor Goba, a clinical psychologist, says that the question of feeling like your therapist “gets it” is one that speaks more to the larger issue and need for cultural competence. “Just because a therapist looks like you doesn’t mean that they will be competent,” Goba says. Studies have shown that matching therapists and clients based on race and identity does not always lead to better therapy, she adds. What does cultural competence look like in practice? Learning about different cultures and religions, being mindful of verbal and   interactions, and checking yourself for your own stigma, Goba explains. Being humble is also key. Even if there are similarities, there will undoubtedly be differences too, she warns. In some instances, Goba says, it is imperative to match therapists with clients correctly. This might be the case with female survivors of domestic abuse, for instance, where having a male therapist could be “retriggering”. Not all   have minded an identity mismatch. Adela Brito, a    special education teacher, says that the therapist she worked with for four years as a young woman appeared to have little in common with her background  —   he was   male and white  —   but that was fine by her.  “He kind of had that Full House, Danny Tanner look. He looked like that suburban dad that you see on TV. ” Brito, who identifies as Latina and entered therapy after attempting suicide and being diagnosed with depression, says that what she needed was to be listened to, and not feel judged  —   a feeling previous therapists she had briefly tried (also male and white) had not given her. “With him, I could be raw. He had a very opening space. He didn’t force anything on me. He was empathetic with my family  —   my mom and our situation, the fact that she didn’t speak English. ” “He gave me a lot of coping mechanisms, he was able to explain things without making me feeling dumb. ” While Brito was in therapy she was juggling an outside life on a full scholarship at a predominantly white college where she felt pressure to not fail a single class and be unfailingly articulate. “When you’re a minority in a majority white school, you have this weight on your shoulders, like I was representing the Latino community. That’s not the way it should be, but that’s the reality. ” “Any little   and it’s like there goes the brown girl,” she says. During a therapy session there was never such a burden. Qusai Hammouri, a    Jordanian spine surgeon and artist based in the US, says that when he first sought therapy, he was looking for someone who was unlike him. He wanted someone who was   and spoke more than one language, but not someone who came from a similar cultural background to avoid having someone who was brought up “with the same prejudices” he explains.  “It was important to me for my therapist to not think that I was doing what I was doing because I am Jordanian. That’s too simple. I have many more layers than this. ” The therapist he found, and with whom he worked for five years, was an Austrian woman. He thought a woman  —   rather than a man  —   would be more sympathetic and helpful when it came to coming to terms with issues tied to his sexuality and the idea of what a family unit could look like. “Working with someone who was multicultural but different than me, it was interesting  —   sometimes she made me explain certain cultural contexts that she didn’t know about. Something I never would have had to do with someone from my culture. And when I did that, explaining the meaning of a specific word or context, that made me realize how much it doesn’t make sense. ” Brito, the special education teacher, says that sometimes the most understanding you can be starts with the very opposite feeling. “Understanding is partly saying hey, I don’t understand that completely, tell me about it, and then listening. ”"

I was nasty about it. ”’ ’Of Bush, Trump resurrected his ” ” label of the   2016 presidential candidate.’ ’”Jeb hasn’’t done it yet,” Trump said regarding Bush endorsing his candidacy. ”He will get a burst of energy, and then he will do it.

2016-05-31,"This post was updated at 5:30 p. m. EDT.  At least $1. 9 million of the donations to veterans groups that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reported on Tuesday came in last week, after Trump began responding to intense media scrutiny of his earlier claims about raising in excess of $6 million for veterans. Trump said on Tuesday that his efforts raised a total of $5. 6 million. NPR reached out to all 41 of the groups Trump listed as receiving donations. Of those, 31 responded. One group, the Navy SEAL Foundation, said it does not disclose details of its donations. The other 30 confirmed the amounts Trump reported Tuesday, accounting for $4. 27 million of the $5. 6 million total. The donations came in from a combination of sources, including the Donald J. Trump Foundation, various groups and individuals who cited Trump’s efforts along with their donations, and Trump himself. The candidate gave a $1 million check to the Marine   Enforcement Foundation on May 24, as questions from the Washington Post and other news outlets about Trump’s prior claims regarding these donations accelerated. Prior to Tuesday, only about $4 million of the fund had been accounted for as paid to veterans charities and service organizations through reporting by various news organizations, chiefly the Post. Trump engaged in a social media battle over the issue with that publication, saying he is being attacked for trying do to something for veterans, always adding that raising millions of dollars was something he didn’t have to do. ”I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job,” Trump complained. Tuesday, in his most combative news conference yet, in a campaign where he has set a new standard for a contentious relationship with the news media, Trump finally addressed the matter before reporters. Speaking at his namesake Trump Tower in New York City, he continued to attack journalists for even asking questions about where the money went. Trump grudgingly released the list of organizations that he says got the money. He predicted the $5. 6 million total that he cited will continue to grow, to eventually top the $6 million figure he claimed back at the event where he first solicited donations to veterans, in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 28. Here’s the full list. But Trump continued to attack the press for asking for accountability about the money. He called reporters ”extremely dishonest,” ”sleazy,” ”biased,” ”nasty,” ”not good people” and more. He added, ”The press should be ashamed of themselves. On behalf of the vets they should be ashamed of themselves.” Trump also asserted that all of the money had gone to the groups, and that ”zero dollars” went to administrative costs. Finally, he offered reasons for the delay in releasing the list of recipients. Trump said organizations needed to be vetted to ensure their legitimacy and their nonprofit status. ”We needed to vet the vets.” Plus, he insisted that he wanted to do all of this privately, that he ”didn’t want credit.” One reporter asked, if Trump didn’t want credit, then why repeatedly remind people at events and on television that he’d raised $6 million for veterans? Isn’t that ”taking credit” the reporter added? Trump responded, ”It’s not.” One shouted question was, ”Don’t you believe you should be accountable?” Trump responded, ”I’m totally accountable. But I didn’t want credit for it.” At another point Trump said simply, ”I don’t think it’s anybody’s business if I want to send money to the vets.” He was asked why he resents the mere act of verifying the contributions. Trump said, ”Because I wanted to make this out of the goodness of my heart. I didn’t want to do this where the press was involved.” And, from a Fox News journalist, ”Is asking a question an attack?” Trump shot back, ”From the political press it is, I see the stories they write.” It went on like this for 40 minutes. Reporters probing and pushing for information. Trump making no attempt to hide his contempt for them. One questioner wondered if this is what it would be like when a President Trump meets with the White House Press Corps. The candidate shot back, ”Yes, it is.”"

2016-06-02,"President Barack Obama is giving up on some of the American manufacturing jobs that went to Mexico, telling an Indiana resident that many of those jobs are not coming back. [During a town hall in Elkhart, Indiana, Obama was asked a question about manufacturing by a man who was once employed by Carrier Corporation in Indiana before the plant announced plans to move to Mexico.  “What we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs that are coming in now because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back,” Obama said bluntly during the event broadcast on PBS. Carrier announced in February that it would move 1, 400 jobs to Mexico  —   even after receiving $5. 1 million from the Obama administration in clean energy tax credits. Carrier later clarified in a statement that it will not claim the federal tax credit. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has cited Carrier specifically on the campaign trail, saying it’s one more sign of American decline. “I wanna do the number on Carrier, folks. I don’t like what they did,” Trump said  in April, vowing to bring the jobs back. But Obama was skeptical that Trump could fulfill his promise. “There’s no answer to it. He just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal.’ Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have?” Obama asked. “And usually, the answer is he doesn’t have an answer. ” Obama insisted that the “good old days” of manufacturing were over, thanks to technology. “The days when you just being willing to work hard and you can now walk into a plant and suddenly there’s going to be a job for you for 30 years or 40 years, that’s just not going to be there for our kids,” Obama said. He blamed technology and automation for the decreasing level of manufacturing jobs, suggesting that free community college would help students learn the skills necessary to compete for high tech jobs. “[Y]ou cannot look backwards, and that doesn’t make folks feel good sometimes, especially if it’s a town that was reliant on a couple of big manufacturers,” he said. “But they’re going to have to retrain for the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past. ”"
2016-06-03,"My central supposition about this election is that Donald Trump will lose because most regular middle Americans just won’t vote to make that man their president. This has nothing to do with ideology. It’s just about Trump. Not everyone out there adores Hillary Clinton by a long shot, and I understand well that for a lot of people this is a choice between beef liver and lumpfish, but I just think at the end of the day most people will say, No, I just can’t —  I just can’t help make that crude, boorish, vindictive, childish man the president of the United States. I think this is what will save Clinton —  and the country —  in the end. But as soon as I think that, I think: But what if I’m wrong? What could make people change their views on Trump, become sympathetic to him? In theory, a number of things. Trump could stop being crude, boorish, vindictive, and childish. (I said “in theory. ”) Clinton could be indicted. The economy could tank. I think those are unlikely —  and yes, I saw the jobs report, but it’s early days to start talking about a recession, and it may be a silver lining of the report that it makes the Fed wait longer to raise rates, which most economists I talk to think it should do anyway. But here’s one thing that’s not a long shot —  and is in fact happening right now —  that I fear will make Trump a more sympathetic figure to the kinds of Americans I’m talking about:   protestors turning violent and throwing eggs at Trump supporters and burning hats and flags.

2016-06-04,"Muhammad Ali was The Greatest. Period. If you just asked him, he’d tell you. He’d tell you he was the double greatest; that he’d “handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail. ” But what made The Champ the greatest  —   what truly separated him from everyone else  —   is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing. He shook up the world, and the world’s better for it. Rest in peace, Champ.   —   President Obama (@POTUS)  Like everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing. But we’re also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a while; for how fortunate we all are that The Greatest chose to grace our time. In my private study, just off the Oval Office, I keep a pair of his gloves on display, just under that iconic photograph of him  —   the young champ, just 22 years old, roaring like a lion over a fallen Sonny Liston.  I was too young when it was taken to understand who he was  —   still Cassius Clay, already an Olympic Gold Medal winner, yet to set out on a spiritual journey that would lead him to his Muslim faith, exile him at the peak of his power, and set the stage for his return to greatness with a name as familiar to the downtrodden in the slums of Southeast Asia and the villages of Africa as it was to cheering crowds in Madison Square Garden. “I am America,” he once declared. “I am the part you won’t recognize. But get used to me  —   black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me. ”  That’s the Ali I came to know as I came of age  —   not just as skilled a poet on the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was right. A man who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela; stood up when it was hard; spoke out when others wouldn’t.  We watched a hero light a torch, and fight his greatest fight of all on the world stage once again; a battle against the disease that ravaged his body, but couldn’t take the spark from his eyes. His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today. He wasn’t perfect, of course. For all his magic in the ring, he could be careless with his words, and full of contradictions as his faith evolved. But his wonderful, infectious, even innocent spirit ultimately won him more fans than foes  —   maybe because in him, we hoped to see something of ourselves.  Later, as his physical powers ebbed, he became an even more powerful force for peace and reconciliation around the world. We saw a man who said he was so mean he’d make medicine sick reveal a soft spot, visiting children with illness and disability around the world, telling them they, too, could become the greatest.  We watched a hero light a torch, and fight his greatest fight of all on the world stage once again; a battle against the disease that ravaged his body, but couldn’t take the spark from his eyes. Muhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it. We are all better for it. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family, and we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace. ”We pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace.”  —  President Obama   —   Barack Obama (@BarackObama) "
2016-06-05,"Fox News Channel’s “Justice” aired an interview between Judge Jeanine Pirro and Donald Trump Saturday, and the presumptive GOP presidential nominee predicted he would be able to unite the people of the United States, unlike President Barack Obama.  “I tell you what, Barack Obama has been a terrible president, but he’s been a tremendous divider. He has divided this country from rich and poor, black and white  —   he has divided this country like no president in my opinion, almost ever,” Trump stated. “The one thing I thought he could do is bring people together, and it turned out to be just the opposite. I will bring people together. ”  Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent"
2016-06-06," The Caligulan malice with which Donald Trump administered Paul Ryan’s degradation is an object lesson in the price of abject capitulation to power. This episode should be studied as a clinical case of a particular Washington myopia  —   the ability of career politicians to convince themselves that they and their agendas are of supreme importance.  The pornographic politics of Trump’s presidential campaign, which was preceded by decades of ignorant bile (about Barack Obama’s birth certificate and much else) have not exhausted Trump’s eagerness to plumb new depths of destructiveness. Herewith the remarkably brief timeline of the breaking of Ryan to Trump’s saddle.  On May 3, Trump won the Indiana primary, ending competition for the Republican nomination. On May 5, Ryan said he still was not prepared to endorse Trump. That day Trump responded that he was not ready to endorse Ryan’s agenda. This was not news, considering that Trump has campaigned against every significant element of this agenda  —   entitlement reform, the rule of law, revival of Congress as a counter to the executive overreach that Obama has practiced and that Trump promises to enlarge upon.  On May 12, a Trump meeting with Ryan resulted in a cringeworthy joint statement that had to be read to be properly disbelieved. The two spoke about the “great conversation” they had about “our shared principles. ” They celebrated their “many important areas of common ground” while offhandedly mentioning “our few differences. ” Those who know, or thought they knew, Ryan doubted that he could name a single shared principle, and he did not do so.  In spite of, and in conspicuous dissonance with, the May 12 happy talk, Ryan continued to withhold his endorsement. Perhaps he hoped that Trump, at age 69, was going to mend his manners.  Instead, Trump dragged a personal problem, his coming trial on fraud charges associated with Trump University, into the presidential campaign. Having first done so in February, on May 27 he again attacked the “Mexican” judge (born in Indiana, 1, 332 miles from Mexico) who will preside at the trial, asserting that the Hoosier Mexican was unfit to preside because his ethnic heritage would incline him against Trump, the   scourge of Mexican rapists. On May 30, Trump again attacked the judge, again embracing the identity politics that actually characterizes contemporary progressivism: An individual has, always and only, the interests and motivations of his race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation.  By June 2, Ryan had heard enough. He endorsed Trump. He did so because President Trump would sign Ryan’s House “agenda. ” Well. Since May 5, the Hamlet of southeastern Wisconsin had indeed learned something. He had learned Trump’s contemptuous response to his scruples. Trump’s response was an insouciant intensification of his   politics  —   the judicial system, too, is “rigged. ” Ryan limply described Trump’s attack on the judge as thinking “out of left field” that he could not “relate to. ”  All supposedly will be redeemed by the House agenda. So, assume, fancifully, that in 2017 this agenda emerges intact from a House not yet proved able to pass 12 appropriations bills. Assume, too, that Republicans still control the Senate and can persuade enough Democrats to push the House agenda over the   threshold. Now, for some really strenuous assuming: Assume that whatever semblance of the House agenda that reaches President Trump’s desk is more important than keeping this impetuous, vicious, ignorant and   man from being at that desk. Some say in extenuation of Ryan’s behavior that if he could not embrace Trump, he could not continue as speaker. But is Ryan, who was reluctant to become speaker, now more indispensable to the nation’s civic health than Trump is menacing to that health? Ryan could have enhanced that health by valuing it above his office.  In March, Trump said of Ryan: “I’m sure I’m going to get along great with him. And if I don’t, he’s going to have to pay a big price. ” Ryan has now paid a staggering price by getting along with Trump. And what did Ryan purchase with the coin of his reputation? Perhaps his agenda.  In Robert Bolt’s play “A Man for All Seasons,” Thomas More is betrayed by Richard Rich, who commits perjury to please the king, in exchange for being named attorney general for Wales. Says More: “Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world. . . . But for Wales?” Or for the House agenda?  Read more from George F.

2016-06-07," After securing the southern edge of   Fallujah, seven battalions of Iraqi special forces units have been unable to advance for two days    a delay that commanders say isn’t due to counterattacks or difficult terrain, but rather to disagreements about battlefield strategy among the disparate Iraqi forces fighting the Islamic State group. Unlike previous   operations, the fight for Fallujah involves an array of Iraqi security forces. A battle plan that was initially cast as an example of how those fighters can work together has instead revealed just how fractured Iraq’s security forces are. ”I wouldn’t say the different forces in the Fallujah operation are cooperating: They’ve just divided up the battlefield,” said Patrick Martin, an Iraq analyst with the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington. Since IS overran Mosul in the summer of 2014, two groups have come to dominate the fight against the militant group in Iraq: The country’s elite counterterrorism special forces and the   largely Shiite militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. Once highly centralized under former Prime Minister Nouri   Iraq’s security forces have splintered under the weight of the political and security crises that were unleashed by the IS blitz across Iraq two years ago. Iraq’s military largely disintegrated in the face of that assault, and in the days that followed, a number of largely Shiite militia groups took up arms against IS and stopped their advance north of Baghdad. While rebuilding Iraq’s military has been a slow process with mixed results, Iraq’s Shiite militias have quickly grown in strength. More powerful than the country’s own military, the militia fighters were formally incorporated into the Iraqi government force under command of the prime minister. But most maintain a large degree of autonomy under leaders with greater political and military clout than the increasingly embattled prime minister, Haider  . Iraq’s special forces units were the one branch of Iraq’s military that was largely untouched by the 2014 collapse. The elite troops, who operate separately from the Ministry of Defense and are products of a   intense U. S. training program, quickly took the lead in a number of key battles against IS across Iraq. In the battle for Fallujah, both forces are participating in the operation to retake the highly symbolic city located about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Baghdad. The counterterrorism troops have been tasked with entering the city itself and the Popular Mobilization Forces have so far been restricted to clearing and securing Fallujah’s outskirts. Both groups maintain their own command and control structure, creating a more   planning process than in recent   operations in Anbar province where the counterterrorism forces largely worked alone. Maj. Ahmed Na’im with the Anbar police force says while his men and the Iraqi federal police are fighting the same enemy in the same city, they never coordinate operations or share intelligence. ”They have their own plans and take their orders from their own people,” he said. Two days after taking up positions on the outskirts of Fallujah, one such dispute brought operations to a halt on Tuesday. The disagreement involved who should participate in the operation to clear the city of IS fighters before an advance into Fallujah could begin, with some Shiite militiamen insisting they be part of that mission, said a senior Iraqi security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. The Popular Mobilization Forces denied that, saying their fighters were ready to enter Fallujah if given the order but were standing down for now, said Hayder Mayahi, an official with the group’s media office overseeing the Fallujah operation. The spokesman for the U. S.  coalition downplayed any suggestion that the operation had stalled. ”Iraqi forces are positioning to move forward,” said Col. Christopher Garver. ”These are things that happen on the battlefield,” he said, referring to the dispute over how the battle should progress. Still, just south of Fallujah’s Shuhada neighborhood, the only evidence of an ongoing operation Tuesday was the occasional round of Iraqi artillery fired into the city. By noon not a single coalition airstrike had been called in. A week earlier, coalition planes were averaging 25 to 30 strikes per day. Meanwhile, aid groups were increasingly expressing concern for the estimated 50, 000 civilians trapped inside the city. In the months prior to the start of the operation, a siege around Fallujah led to reports of malnutrition as the price of food skyrocketed. Since the start of the assault to retake the city two weeks ago, conditions for civilians in Fallujah have swiftly deteriorated. Fallujah residents speaking to the Associated Press by phone said during the first few days IS fighters handed out water and simple rations to civilians inside the city, but since then no further supplies have made it in. ”Another humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in Fallujah and the worst is yet to come,” said Bruno Geddo, the representative for the United Nation’s refugee agency in Iraq. Meanwhile, the U. N. human rights chief said there were ”credible reports” that Iraqis fleeing Fallujah were facing physical abuse as they escaped the city held by Islamic State militants. In a statement Tuesday from his office in Geneva, Zeid Ra’ad   cited witness accounts that armed groups backing Iraqi security forces have detained some men and teenage boys leaving Fallujah with force that at times ”degenerates” into abuse. Zeid acknowledged that Iraqi forces have a ”legitimate interest in vetting individuals fleeing   areas” to make sure they don’t pose a security risk, but said those fleeing must be presumed to be civilians, barring ”clear and cogent evidence to the contrary.”"
2016-06-08,"JERUSALEM   —   A Central Committee member of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party praised terrorists who carry out stabbing attacks on Israelis, saying they “performed miracles” and adding that anyone who supports peace efforts with the Israelis is not a real Palestinian. [“This people is greater than its leadership. The determination, willpower, and willingness to die for a dignified life are present among the youth who carried a knife after the disappearance of the Arab leadership, including the Palestinian. They performed a miracle by imposing a curfew within Israel with knives and rocks,” Abbas Zaki said.  He made his speech at a graduation ceremony held at the Palestinian Red Crescent headquarters in honor of the faculty of UNRWA Ramallah Women’s Training Center. UNWRA  —   the United Nations Relief and Works Agency  —   is a UN body specifically for Palestinian refugees. Both UNRWA and the Palestinian Red Crescent have hosted   events as recently as April. In the clip, which was exposed on Tuesday by Israeli NGO Palestinian Media Watch, Zaki also praised the parents of terrorists: “Blessings to the mothers and fathers who gave birth to those who are marching on the path of light,” he said. Zaki continued by slamming those who put their hopes in making peace, saying that anyone who “talks about renewing the relations with Israel is not a Palestinian and not a member of Fatah. ” Earlier this year, Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen described both Abbas Zaki and the Fatah movement as “moderate. ” In response, PMW authored a report documenting Zaki and the movement’s endorsement of terror during the recent wave of violence. The report resulted in a debate in the Danish parliament with Jensen dismissing the claims."
2016-06-09,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. The day after she sealed the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton took a victory lap of the nation’s top newsrooms and delivered the most predictable and practiced comments. She honored her mother. She trashed Donald Trump. She wooed Bernie Sanders’ supporters. Hillary Clinton, Tracy Flick, and the Reclaiming of Female Ambition, It was a Trumpian triumph of message management. She fielded a few softball questions (“Did you actually end up choking up?” one reporter asked with regard to Clinton’s Tuesday night speech, adding later: “With your permission we’ll pivot to, back to hard politics”) and the headlines broke her way (“Hillary Clinton Hits Donald Trump on Economics” and “Hillary Clinton on Winning, and Why Her Mother Would Be Nervous”). Reading through the interview transcripts and stories, I found nuggets buried deep in the coverage that offer a less flattering portrait of Clinton —  that would suggest her presidency might lack transparency, candor, and accountability. The CNN interview suggests how tone deaf Clinton has become about ethics, specifically concerning how she and her husband blurred the line between her work as secretary of state and their family foundation: The former secretary of state also defended her family’s Clinton Foundation, saying she is ”proud of the work it has done” and arguing that foreign countries’ contributions to the foundation do nothing to influence her political actions. ”Money that has been given to the foundation goes to support humanitarian work. And if people want to influence anybody in office, I think they would choose the political work. And indeed, the work of the foundation really speaks for itself,” Clinton said. As for whether her husband, Bill Clinton, would cut his ties to the foundation, she said that ”we will cross that bridge if and when we get there.” When I covered the Clintons in Arkansas, they understood how the public’s trust could be squandered by the mere whiff of wrongdoing. They were champions of state ethics reform. I suspect they would have objected had the president at the time, George H. W. Bush, allowed his family foundation to solicit money from corporations and foreign governments hoping to influence him. Just as maddening, Clinton doesn’t seem to understand the outrage over her Wall Street speeches. From The New York Times: Mrs. Clinton offered a vigorous defense of a decision which has haunted her primary campaign —  her acceptance of large amounts of money for giving speeches to Wall Street banks, a practice that even her most ardent supporters have viewed as puzzlingly  . Mrs. Clinton called such speeches that garner   fees “the norm” for previous secretaries of state. “I actually think it makes sense,” she added. When pressed on why, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the Occupy Wall Street movement, she chose to give such speeches, Mrs. Clinton reiterated that she had put forth “the most specific plan” of any candidate to regulate the financial industry. “A lot of people know you have a   seat in what is going on in the world, so maybe you have some interesting observations about political or economic concerns,” Mrs. Clinton explained. “That to me is how it came about, and that’s what I talked about when I was making speeches. ” For a liberal Democrat with ambitions to be president at a time of surging populism, working for Wall Street is not “the norm. ” Even if past secretaries of state cashed in on their service, that doesn’t make it right —  especially for Clinton, who had reason to believe she might run for president. Her lack of accountability shines through in the interview with Washington Post reporter Anne Gearan. Clinton takes no responsibility for her low approval and credibility ratings. AG: What does it say about the country at this moment that both you and Donald Trump have the highest negatives of any major party nominees in probably our lifetimes, if not more? And specifically, what does that say about you as you start this    contest with him? HC: [Sighs or draws a breath] Well, Anne, I think what it says about me is that when I serve in jobs, like senator or secretary of state, I have, you know, high approval ratings. I think when I was serving as secretary of state, and you covered a lot of that, I had an approval rating of 66 percent. But I’m also the, you know, very favorite target of Republicans, and others who disagree with my positions. And they’ve been running many millions of dollars of ads against me ever since this campaign started. With CBS, Clinton briefly acknowledges her personal responsibility, but only as a pivot to Republicans. However, it’s possible that Clinton’s biggest obstacle is not her opponent but herself.   percent of the American people who participated in a CBS news poll have an unfavorable opinion of Clinton —  the highest negative impression of anyone ever nominated by the Democratic Party since the poll began in 1984. Does she bear any responsibility for that? ”Oh, I’m sure I do, but I think —  When I was secretary of state and serving our country, I had an approval rating of 66 percent, and I think it’s fair to ask, ’Well, what’s happened? ’” Clinton responded. ”And what’s happened is tens of millions of dollars of negative advertising and coverage that has been sent my way.” What has most undermined Clinton’s credibility in this election is her decision to place her State Department email on a secret private server and, once discovered, her misleading statements about the email system. Inexplicably, most interviewers ignored the issue or gave it short thrift. Not Bret Baier of FOX News. Clinton reaffirmed a statement she made to a radio station on Friday that there is ”absolutely no possibility of an indictment.” ”There is no basis for it, and I’m looking forward to this being wrapped up as soon as possible,” Clinton said. Unless she has been given a   briefing on the investigation, which would be highly unusual and unethical, Clinton does not know for certain what the FBI has uncovered or what the Department of Justice might do. Baier pressed her on why neither she nor her aides talked to the State Department inspector general about her email use, after saying that she would talk to ”anybody anytime.” She said that she has ”talked endlessly” about the emails, including for 11 hours before a House committee. ”What they wanted to ask, we’d already talked about. Talked about in the public arena,” Clinton said. That’s a dodge. She cannot know what the inspector general wants to talk about because she has refused to meet with him, despite promising to do so. She told Baier that she did not recall signing a   agreement in 2009 about the handling of classified materials, but regardless, nothing she sent or received was marked classified at the time. ”What you are seeing acted out is the desire of the different parts of the government to retroactively classify material so that it is not made public, since I did ask that all my   be made public, and this is not an uncommon process.” Surely, Clinton knows that answer is misleading: It doesn’t matter whether the material was marked classified or not. Much of the nation’s deepest secrets are not marked. People have been prosecuted for mishandling unmarked material. Finally, Baier asked Clinton straightforwardly: ”The Clinton Foundation investigation, the FBI investigation, the   you’re saying zero chance that this is a problem for you in this election?” Clinton responded: ”Absolutely. That’s what I’m saying.  That happens to be the truth.” For as much as she need voters to believe her declarations of innocence, most Americans don’t trust her. That happens to be the truth."

2016-06-13,"Something has changed, and it’s not the availability of guns in the United States. Consider the following facts: According to data from the New America Foundation’s International Security Program, from September 12, 2001, until the rise of ISIS in the late spring of 2014, jihadists killed 21 Americans in terror attacks here at home. Only three Americans died during the    phase of the Bush administration. From April to June, 2014, Ali Muhammed Brown killed four Americans on a “mission of vengeance” against the United States. On September 25, 2014, Alton Nolen beheaded an Oklahoma woman with a knife. His social media pages were covered with evidence of jihadist leanings and motivations. On July 16, 2015, Mohammad Abdulazeez killed five people at two Chattanooga recruiting stations. FBI director James Comey declared that Abdulazeez was “ ” by terrorist propaganda. On November 4, 2015, Faisal Mohammed went on an   stabbing spree  —   wounding four  —   before he was killed by campus police. On December 2, 2015, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik pledged allegiance to ISIS then killed 14 people and wounded 21 at a Christmas party in San Bernardino, Calif. On January 8, 2015, Edward Archer pledged himself to ISIS and attempted to assassinate a Philadelphia police officer. The wounded officer chased down and apprehended Archer before he could commit any other acts of violence. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen pledged himself to ISIS and killed 49 people and wounds 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando. This death toll at home is augmented by an extraordinary toll overseas  —   with Paris facing repeated violent attacks, Brussels bombed, a Russian airliner brought down, and   violence reaching all the way to Australia. Yet if you watched Twitter yesterday, you would have seen entire quarters of the Left react with political fury, actually blaming the NRA for Sunday morning’s massacre and demanding greater gun regulation. In fact, in some quarters, there was far greater rage at gun owners and politicians who protect the Second Amendment than there was at the actual terrorist who slaughtered Americans or the terrorist army that inspired him. It was, quite frankly, stunning. And it misses the point. ISIS is a   and the idea that gun control will make America safe from jihadists is sheer fantasy.  ’s calling card was the spectacular strike  —   blowing up embassies, almost sinking an American warship, bringing down the World Trade Center  —   but once America finally woke up to the danger, we were able to protect ourselves from the elaborate attack. ISIS, however, has learned the West’s true vulnerability. A free society simply can’t police everyone at once, and a relentless propaganda campaign aimed at radicals worldwide will yield jihadists who are ready to kill with any and all weapons available. The Paris attacks were conducted in a nation with far tighter gun controls than any state in the United States, and it resulted in more than twice the casualties of Orlando. Europe has suffered more than the U. S. in spite of its restrictive legal regime. The virus is spreading. The   debate is nothing more than a destructive distraction. Is there a single viable   proposal of the last decade that would keep a committed jihadist from arming himself? Indeed, the   debate keeps us from focusing on the true danger: a terrorist movement that’s learning how to attack a free society. It keeps us from focusing on the terrorists’ capabilities and motivations. It keeps us from asking the very hard questions about how to defeat a movement that’s based not just in a jihadist army that takes and holds territory but also in an ancient religious idea that has never gone away. Against that backdrop, I can understand the very human temptation to fix one’s attention not on the colossal challenge of jihad but on the seemingly more manageable and more familiar challenge of attacking Republicans. Focusing on jihad means looking Islam in the face. Focusing on jihad means rethinking   assumptions about policy, politics, and liberal coalitions. Focusing on jihad means recognizing that many Muslim members of the leftist coalition actually, truly hate the LGBT side of the liberal alliance. And so progressives are left with gun control as a unifying argument. They can’t resolve the irresolvable tension between championing Islam while also championing LGBT rights, so they punt. They lash out at the familiar bogeymen on the right. But terrorists don’t care. NRA or no NRA, they’ll keep trying to kill Americans, and they’ll keep succeeding until we finally wake up and realize that guns aren’t the enemy  —   jihadists are.,"
2016-06-14,"Many people are surely asking, “What if the Orlando murderer had been a Christian?” Why? Because little being said now by the mainstream media and by leading Democratic politicians from the president on down would be said if the murderer were an   Christian. So let’s imagine that it was a   Christian who had murdered nearly 50 gays and badly injured 50 more. America would be inundated with attacks on Christians, Christianity, religion, and the Bible. This is not theoretical speculation. For example, the mainstream media and other voices on the left regularly cite one family  —   literally one family, the Phelps family  —   in order to demonstrate how “homophobic” conservative Christians are. The family, the “Westboro Baptist Church,” has fewer than 40 members  —   nine of the late patriarch Fred Phelps’s 13 children, and some of his children and grandchildren. This     and   family represents no group, no ideology, and no religion, and is regularly denounced by every Christian denomination, including conservative Evangelicals. Nevertheless, Westboro is frequently cited by the media and LGBT groups as if it were representative of conservative Christians. Now, imagine if a Christian unaffiliated with the Phelps family had been the Orlando murderer. We would be inundated with commentary on the dangers posed by the religious Right, fundamentalist Christians, etc. Share article on FacebookshareTweet There are two reasons this is so significant. First, the Left has been waging a war against Christianity. Writers on the left deny and mock this notion. But that only illustrates a lack of intellectual honesty. Why, for example, have companies throughout America felt it necessary to rename Christmas parties “holiday parties”? What holiday other than Christmas are these parties celebrating? Surely not New Year’s  —   such parties are always announced as New Year’s parties and not Chanukah  —   Jewish groups have Chanukah parties. Furthermore, since Marx, the Left  —   not traditional liberals the Left  —   everywhere has opposed Christianity. Leftism is a secular religion. And wherever traditional Christianity (or traditional Judaism) is strong, the Left understands that it cannot vanquish society. In Europe, Leftism has been almost wholly successful in supplanting Christianity. In Latin America, the Left has worked to remake Christianity in its image through “Liberation Theology,” which is essentially Marxism with Christ. Thus, if the Orlando murderer were a Christian, that is almost all we would hear about. After all, the Left labels as “Christian” even mass murderers who have no affiliation with Christianity  —   Timothy McVeigh, for example. The second reason the Left would be preoccupied with attacking Christianity if the Orlando murderer had been a Christian would be to help it maintain the fiction that Islam is “a religion of peace. ” RELATED: Most Western Gays Remain in Denial about Islam, Now, Islam has never been a religion of peace. It began as a warlike religion and throughout its history, whenever possible, made war on    —   from the polytheists of North Africa to the Hindus of India, about 60 to 80 million of whom Muslims killed during their   rule there. So, while the Left would emphasize a murderer’s Christian faith, it denies that Islam plays any role in the vast amount of Islamic murder, torture, enslavement, female genital mutilation, unparalleled subjugation of women, and rape. Virtually every American and European schoolchild learns of the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and the Christian West’s role in slavery, but nothing of the Islamic world’s centuries of mass slaughter and vast enslavement of Europeans and Africans. Why? Because the truth about Islam’s historical record of violence would shine a light on the Christian West’s far superior moral record. So the Left employs a dual tactic: to portray Islam as benign and Christianity as malicious.

2016-06-15," At a Monday vigil in Salt Lake City for the victims of the Orlando shooting, Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox gave a moving, tearful speech apologizing to the LGBTQ community for treating them poorly in his early life, and expressing gratitude to them for helping him realize the error of his ways.    It’s an incredible speech full of empathy and humility, and it’s worth watching in full. The speech is not only a moving tribute to the Orlando victims  —   it’s also a great example of how to be a good ally to marginalized communities that you support but aren’t a member of. Cox started off saying that he had ”an admission and an apology” for the vigil attendees: ”I recognize fully that I am a balding, youngish,   straight, white, male, Republican politician” (many in the crowd burst into laughter at this) ”with all of the expectations and privileges that come with those labels. I am probably not who you expected to hear from today.” Cox continued: ”I’m here because yesterday morning, 49 Americans were brutally murdered. . .. I’m here because those 49 people were gay. I’m here because it shouldn’t matter. But I’m here because it does.”    This was a powerful line, since it’s common for people to express support for LGBTQ Americans by saying something like, ”It doesn’t matter if you’re gay.” It’s a   statement against homophobia. But it can also pose similar problems to the idea of ”colorblindness,” which many Americans were raised to believe was an   sentiment  —   but which can actually help obscure more subtle forms of discrimination. To many LGBTQ people and people of color, this part of their identity does matter a great deal. It’s part of who they are, and it’s also the reason they are sometimes hated and discriminated against.    Cox continued in a similar vein, conscious of his status as a straight man who can’t fully understand the lived experience of being LGBTQ but who feels empathy and solidarity with them:  I am not here to tell you that I know exactly what you are going through. I am not here to tell you that I feel your pain. I don’t pretend to know the depths of what you are feeling right now. But I do know what it feels like to be scared. And I do know what it feels like to be sad. And I do know what it feels like to be rejected. And, more importantly, I know what it feels like to be loved.     Cox talked about how he grew up in a small, rural town and that sometimes he ”wasn’t kind” to kids in his high school class who were ”different.” ”I didn’t know it at the time, but I know now that they were gay. I regret not treating them with the kindness, dignity, and respect  —   the love  —   that they deserved. For that, I sincerely and humbly apologize.” Since then, he said, ”My heart has changed. It has changed because of you. It has changed because I have gotten to know many of you. You have been patient with me.”    Cox said that the 49 ”beautiful, amazing people” who died in the attack ”are not just statistics. These were individuals. These are human beings. They each have a story. They each had dreams, goals, talents, friends, family. They are you, and they are me.” He concluded by asking listeners to ”be a little kinder,” and to try to love someone who is different from them. ”For my straight friends, might I suggest starting with someone who is gay,” he said. Cox, who is Mormon, was an outspoken supporter of Utah’s 2015 law prohibiting housing and employment discrimination against LGBTQ people. That law didn’t address controversial public accommodations issues, such as whether a baker can deny service to a gay couple buying a wedding cake. But because the law contained religious exemptions, the Mormon Church supported it fully.  The Orlando mass shooting and history of Pride    "
2016-06-16,"   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Uber faces legal and regulatory battles around the world, the latest of which took place in Austin, Texas, where residents recently voted against a proposition that would have lifted regulations requiring background checks and fingerprinting for drivers. After sinking $8 million into a public campaign and losing, Uber and Lyft chose not to comply with the city’s regulations in favor of immediately pausing operations in Austin (though Uber is continuing to operate its   service, UberEATS, in the city). Uber and Lyft obviously weren’t pleased with that outcome, and many of their drivers were upset by their abrupt decision to leave. Michelle Panas was frustrated: She had driven for Uber in Dallas for two years, even buying a vehicle that met the specifications of the company’s   Uber Select option. She didn’t like Uber’s   policy in Dallas (which requires many drivers with Select vehicles to accept requests from   riders) so she relocated to Austin, only to have Uber and Lyft leave the city shortly afterward. Meanwhile, Dina Sledge, a mother of two, liked that the flexibility of Uber and Lyft allowed her to tailor her schedule to her energy level, which fluctuates because of a disability she has. When she heard the services were leaving town, she considered driving every weekend to San Antonio, roughly 80 miles southwest, so that she could pick up fares there. Despite these frustrations, the departure of Uber and Lyft could actually produce better options for the roughly 10, 000 drivers in Austin, as well as their passengers. Uber and Lyft dominate the ridesharing market in many cities, and what’s called the network effect —  the idea that a platform or service becomes more useful as its number of users increases —  makes it hard for smaller players to compete with them. For that reason, Uber and Lyft’s disappearance from Austin’s market is opening up opportunities for alternative ridesharing arrangements that might not otherwise have a shot. Uber and Lyft’s duopoly in most markets means they can (and do) act more or less as they please. The companies drop fares, impose   rules like   and change policies with little fear of losing drivers or riders. (In some smaller ways, their rivalry has actually helped drivers, according to Harry Campbell, the creator of The Rideshare Guy, a blog that provides information to the industry’s drivers. For instance, Uber handles a much higher volume of rides than Lyft, but it has adopted some of Lyft’s more   policies, like its Express Pay option, which allows drivers to cash out whenever they want, as long as they’ve earned at least $50.) In just over a month since the election in Austin, smaller rideshare startups, including Fare, Fasten, Get Me, and Wingz, have attempted to fill the void left by Uber and Lyft. “Competition in the market helps drivers,” says Daniel Hamermesh, a professor emeritus of economics at University of Texas at Austin. For instance, when Uber and Lyft were still operating, Wingz initially carved out a niche by offering   airport rides, whose predictability benefits riders and drivers alike. (Uber and Lyft are now rolling out   rides and Wingz has branched out beyond airport rides in Austin). The predictability of   rides benefits riders and drivers alike. “If you [as a driver] can get a couple of   rides, you’re able to schedule your day around that,” Campbell says. When drivers know they’re guaranteed a certain amount of money that day from     rides, they’re less susceptible to the volatility of surge pricing and rider demand. “Logistically and mentally it’s better for drivers,” Campbell says. One new entrant to the Austin market, Arcade City, has particularly piqued some drivers’ interest. Panas gushes about driving for Arcade City, which started as a Facebook group and now has over 32, 000 members, who can offer or request rides and exchange contact details via Facebook. “We’re so busy, we barely have time to sleep and shower because it never stops,” Panas says. “Your previous riders are calling and texting you [for rides]. ” Arcade City drivers   into teams (or pods, as they’re called) so that drivers can refer passengers to team members when they’re busy. Arcade City doesn’t require fingerprinting, but Panas likes that the services gives her the ability to check out a potential passenger’s Facebook profile and mutual friends before agreeing to pick him or her up. “Uber and Lyft never vetted the passengers. They never know who the passengers were who were getting into our cars,” she says. Arcade City recently released its mobile app to a group of 100 riders and 50 drivers. At a   event, drivers and passengers crammed into Brave New Books, a local activist bookstore, where they heralded the app’s decentralized model and discussed how to handle possible   with police. Unlike other ridesharing apps operating as transportation network companies (or TNCs) Arcade City considers itself a decentralized autonomous organization, explains its regional director, Eric Green. “The whole thing for the rider is they can choose who they want to drive,” he says, referring to Arcade City’s system of optional fingerprinting and background checks. “It’s about freedom of choice. ” Austin’s mayor, Steve Adler, has said he’s not sure Arcade City is legal, and several publications have called it Austin’s “black market for ridesharing. ” So far, the city has allowed Arcade City to operate as long as fares don’t exceed 54 cents per mile, the federal reimbursement limit for the purposes of making tax deductions. The service has developed a workaround to allow drivers to earn more than that: Instead of setting fares, they accept “donations” offered by passengers. Panas says the donation model works well for her. “Riders are becoming a lot more informed that the Uber and Lyft rates were not sustainable for drivers,” she explains. Arcade City’s lack of structure isn’t for everyone, and RideAustin —  an upstart that is centralized, like Uber, but is a nonprofit —  is more organized. RideAustin is currently testing its service in downtown Austin and plans to scale up after incorporating feedback from its drivers, says Joe Deshotel, the organization’s director of community engagement. “We’re taking the time to do it right,” he says. So far, RideAustin has onboarded 800 drivers, all of whom will be fingerprinted. RideAustin’s website boasts that its nonprofit status will offer lower fares for passengers and higher pay for drivers, a model that Deshotel says he hasn’t seen in other cities. “We don’t really see anything innovative operating [in other] cities because of the nature of the duopoly of Uber and Lyft,” he says. “From our perspective, it has stifled creativity and innovation by having these two companies essentially dominate the market. ” In the race to capture market share, these recent entrants have revealed themselves to be less than perfect —  drivers complain about navigational glitches and long waits to get onboarded. Balancing supply and demand has proven problematic on both sides: Drivers don’t want to waste time signing up for an app that doesn’t have enough passengers, while passengers don’t want to waste storage on their phone with an app that doesn’t have enough drivers. Because Austin’s market is now so competitive, it is likely that not all of the current rideshare players in Austin will survive. Hamermesh predicts that the survivors will be the ones that treat drivers well and give them a relatively high percentage of each fare drivers who feel supported tend to provide a better customer experience. If Uber and Lyft return to Austin in the future, it won’t be the first time they exited a city only to come back later. Both services returned to Florida’s Broward County after a county commission eased up some of its regulations. But what makes Austin different from Broward County is that “there weren’t nine companies lining up to fill that market,” Campbell says. With some other services willing to comply with Austin’s regulations and fill passenger demand, the city will feel less pressure to back down. But even if Uber and Lyft don’t return to Austin, they’ll likely pay attention to what happens there —  not just for the sake of their business interests, but, perhaps, for inspiration."
2016-06-17," Nuclear power has been falling out of favor in Europe ever since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Italy has closed all its reactors. Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland are in the midst of retiring their fleets. Even France, which gets 77 percent of its electricity from nuclear, has been discussing a partial phaseout.    Yet for a continent that prides itself on being a leader on global warming, shutting down a major source of reliable,   electricity isn’t always easy. And Sweden is a great case study here. Until recently, Sweden’s nuclear reactors  —   which provide 40 percent of the nation’s electricity  —   were on track to close prematurely in the coming years, as government policies favored renewables. But last week, the country switched course. Under a new agreement, Sweden will get rid of a key tax that had been hurting nuclear, allowing existing reactors to keep running for longer. The country’s utilities will also now be permitted to build up to 10 new reactors to replace those scheduled to retire. (Though whether they actually do is an open question.) Officially, Sweden still has a goal of moving to 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. But this new policy is, effectively, a backstop. If it turns out to be much harder than expected to power the entire country with wind, hydro, and solar alone  —   as some experts think it could be  —   then nuclear power will remain a ready option.    Why Sweden’s nuclear reactors were in trouble A quick bit of history: After the OPEC oil crises in the 1970s, Sweden went on a   spree to cut its fossil fuel dependence. This was one of the fastest feats of decarbonization the world has ever seen, along with France’s nuclear buildout. Here’s a list of the country’s nine current reactors, sited at three locations:               Nuclear power remains controversial  —   the country has been debating phaseouts since 1980  —   but it does provide real benefits to Sweden’s grid. These nine reactors supply 40 percent of the country’s electricity (hydropower provides another 50 percent, with the rest from wind and fossil fuels). Sweden now has one of the   grids on the planet. And the nation exports surplus electricity to its neighbors, particularly Finland. But in recent years, Sweden’s nuclear reactors have become starkly unprofitable. On June 10, it cost 3. 8 cents per   (kWh) to operate these reactors, on average. But operators only received around 2. 6   for their nuclear electricity.    Why the shortfall? Operating costs have increased in recent years, not least because plants have been required to adopt more stringent safety requirements after the 2011 Fukushima meltdown in Japan. At the same time, electricity prices have plummeted, partly due to economic malaise in Europe and partly due to subsidies that have made wind power artificially cheap in the Nordic power markets. There’s also a third reason: Ever since 2000, Sweden has levied a tax on nuclear power that recently got ratcheted up to nearly 1 cent per kWh. This tax helped raise revenue for renewable investments, reaping $484 million last year. But it was also driving nuclear out of business. Vattenfall, the company that operates seven of these reactors, warned that unless the tax was modified, most of the country’s nuclear power would be shut down by 2020, well ahead of schedule. That looming shutdown posed a dilemma. Many greens wanted to keep the tax, phase out Sweden’s nuclear fleet, and replace that power with wind and solar. But this was looking quite challenging to pull off in practice.    One key difficulty is that nuclear power plants run around the clock, whereas wind power is much more variable (operating at capacity around 30 percent of the time). One   study found that to replace 9, 000 megawatts of nuclear capacity, Sweden would have to build more than 22, 000 megawatts of wind capacity, plus about 8, 600 megawatts’ worth of gas turbines for backup power. By some estimates, building that much wind and gas would cost twice as much as simply keeping the existing reactors open for their remaining life spans. There’s also the question of what to do during Sweden’s winter, when electricity demand for heating soars but wind turbines often shut down due to extreme cold (and solar output drops sharply). A 2015 study in Energy Policy found that a premature shutdown would raise Sweden’s system costs ”disproportionately.” Another study in The European Physical Journal Plus found that replacing the entire nuclear fleet with wind and gas would cause Sweden’s electricity CO2 emissions to double. Swedish industry groups  —   heavy electricity users like Volvo or steelmaker SSAB  —   lobbied to save the reactors. How Sweden’s reactors got a second chance             Ultimately, the prospect of a premature shutdown seemed too daunting. Last Friday, Sweden’s governing Social Democrats and Greens reached a deal with the opposition to scrap the tax on nuclear power over the next two years, giving the existing reactors some room to avoid early closure. They also agreed to permit utilities to build up to 10 reactors at existing sites to replace the ones coming offline in the coming decade. Shortly after the agreement, Vattenfall approved safety upgrades at the three reactors at Forsmark, enabling the plants to continue operating well past 2020. The government still has a goal of 100 percent renewable energy by 2040, but the agreement states this doesn’t necessarily rule out nuclear: ”This is a goal, not a   date that would prohibit nuclear power, and it does not mean either the end a closure of nuclear power.” According to the Financial Times, Energy Minister Ibrahim Baylan said of the deal: ”This is a traditional Swedish compromise.”    There’s still no guarantee that Sweden’s utilities will actually build new nuclear plants. These plants remain extremely costly to construct. Next door in Finland, the French state company Areva is building a   reactor now estimated to cost some $9. 5 billion  —   three times the original price, thanks to delays and overruns. More recently (and controversially) a Finnish consortium decided to partner with Russia’s Rosatom to build a separate reactor in Pyhäjoki in the hopes of lowering costs. It’s unclear what direction Sweden might go for new plants, but it can’t move forward unless the economics work out. The government isn’t offering subsidies for new builds, and wholesale prices are extraordinarily low right now. So some analysts are skeptical that we’ll see a future boom. In any case, it could be interesting to compare Sweden with Germany in the coming years. Germany, as part of its Energiewende plan to tackle global warming, is hoping to get 80 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050 (it’s at 31 percent now). Making this task tougher, the country is attempting this while retiring its unpopular nuclear fleet. You can read about some of Germany’s challenges here. There’s endless debate among energy wonks over whether it’s really feasible to power an entire grid with renewables alone. Germany is betting it (mostly) is. Sweden now appears to be hedging. Further reading:    Note that some US states  —   like California and Illinois  —   are seeing their own debates on whether to save nuclear reactors that are scheduled to shut down prematurely. Amy Harder has a good state of play here.    Sweden also had an interesting strategy for managing its nuclear waste. Rather than having the government decide unilaterally on a site for   geological storage (as the US Congress tried with Yucca Mountain in Nevada) policymakers drew up a list of potential sites and then consulted closely with local residents. The two finalist communities ended up competing against each other to host the waste site (which would mean jobs, money, and so on). The Energy Department has suggested a similar approach here.    Why America abandoned nuclear power (and what we can learn from South Korea) "
2016-06-18,"A few years ago on Father’s Day, my dad, who was then living in Taiwan, forwarded the family a special holiday coupon to one of his favorite places in the world: Souplantation. A sort of glorified salad buffet, Souplantation is the kind of chain restaurant you go to with your family after church or sports games, particularly after the ones you’ve lost. The food doesn’t inflame the senses or your digestive tract. In his email, he urged us to take advantage of the coupon on his behalf —   with an exclamation mark and a note of regret. I imagined him alone in his   condo in Kaohsiung, looking out onto the leafy muddle, dreaming of   chlorophyll. My dad became vegetarian in the ’90s. He meditated regularly, and had a particularly intense session in which he saw humans as livestock raised by aliens. This wasn’t so weird back then. Our favorite show was   and also Sightings. The preeminent threat was alien abductions. That summer of 1995, the popular water cooler topic at dad’s work was the Fox TV special Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction? Dad had apparently spent a considerable amount of time theorizing about extraterrestrial food chains with his coworkers at the computer wholesale company where he worked in technical support. One day he came home and announced he could no longer eat meat. Why not? I remember this announcement sent me into a brief panic. My favorite foods were burgers and dumplings, and already, the opportunities to eat them had dwindled since my grandparents from Taiwan had come to live with us several years before. My grandparents, laconic and mysterious, were also very vegetarian. They belonged to a religion called ”The Persistent Way,” which combined elements of Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese ancestor worship. My grandma told me we had to be vegetarian because we believed in reincarnation. Each time we ate a pig or chicken, we risked eating one of our ancestors. You just never knew when you’d be biting into a forebear. I really didn’t know how to feel about that. The ancestors whose portraits hung above the altar didn’t look very sympathetic.   and grim, they looked like they worked in orphanages. I was scared of them, and felt conflicted about possibly eating them. Should I feel revolted? At school we’d read Charlotte’s Web, so I knew that the key to empathy was to imagine these ancestors as capable of witty internal dialogue. Time was a pool party, a great ocean of past and present, and everyone bobbed inside it, the ancestors and me. Rubbing elbows, Marco Polo. But it didn’t work. Then again, it was immaterial whether or not I understood the theological underpinnings of the Family Laws. The elders had spoken, and they had to be obeyed. Chens Do No Eat Meat. Perhaps to counter our rising indignation, my dad assured my sister and me that his vegetarianism was voluntary and not an attempt to placate his parents. His decision was based on a feeling of compassion for animals, not some superstitious belief that eating animals would accumulate bad karma. Since I did not want to think of his vegetarianism as an act of betrayal, I clung instead to his alien explanation. It seemed, to my    brain, intuitive enough, following the logic of feeling. I imagined the sum of my existence boiled down to pure caloric value. How would I like to get sucked into a UFO to be used as groceries? I wouldn’t like it at all. So it wasn’t nice to do it to animals, either, as good as they tasted. Though dad was happy to let us eat meat whenever we felt like it, my grandparents prohibited us from even bringing it into the house. So my mom changed up her cooking to accommodate them, which meant that she also couldn’t use garlic and onion and other alliaceous plants, as they were considered impure. Not that we had much voting power to begin with, but losing one important member of our   cohort guaranteed that we had no chance of bargaining. My sister and I endured the soggy plates of sautéed sweet potato leaf and ginger, the slimy globs of gluten simmered with seaweed and star anise. We ate without complaining, exercising compassion for my parents. We didn’t want to give them grief. Each bite of egg, tomato, hollow leaf, cabbage, every slurp of bland corn soup was an exercise in compassion. On special occasions, my mom would buy fake meat products from a Buddhist grocer in nearby San Gabriel, Calif. and I would sift through all the   packages, grumbling, wishing for ribs. It seemed hypocritical to me that these products were manufactured to resemble animals. In spirit, we were still eating ”salmon”  —   pink soy patties covered with mats of seaweed skin. We were still picking at fried nubs of gluten with popsicle sticks for bones. All the violence of the encounter was still implicit in the form. Everyone’s compassion seemed phony. ”Grandma and grandpa are always saying they don’t want to kill sentient beings, but I’ve seen her squish flies like it’s nothing,” I’d say. ”She say amituofo before she does it,” dad would say. ”She say sorry to fly in her own way.” ”Why’s she always talking about compassion when she doesn’t have any?” I’d shoot back. ”I don’t think she has any compassion. For example, she has no compassion for my need to eat meat.” ”OK. But you have to be compassion.” We are probably having this   conversation in the car while driving home from morning swim practice. I am probably in the passenger seat, being treated to a Burger King sausage biscuit breakfast sandwich, ungratefully waving it in his face to get him to cheat. I was always trying to tempt him with meat products by wafting what I thought were irresistible odors into his face. Lately his diet had become dangerously anemic: He seemed to subsist entirely on saltines and handfuls of Ibuprofen. ”Come on, take one bite! It’s so good! Don’t you miss it?” I’d tease. ”Stop it! Stop! You want your old daddy to get diarrhea?” This was the other thing he used to say to get us to stop tempting him. After you quit eating meat for a while, your stomach simply loses the ability to digest it. I sank back into my seat. I couldn’t understand compassion, but I could understand diarrhea. We both had codes we could understand. With his analytical brain, he had decided that the code of compassion would account for all the paradoxes of his life. It would account for why he spent his entire life running away from his parents, only to invite them back in to stay. Why he couldn’t stomach the idea of existing for the gustatory enjoyment of aliens, and yet here he was, an instrument of his parent’s desires. I sighed and finished the sausage patty alone. As my parents got busier, struggling in their immigrant way to maintain equilibrium, my grandparents grew more vociferous about our supposed meat eating. Even when we weren’t eating meat, they would accuse us of eating   items. (They eventually got a separate fridge so as not be contaminated by our bad karma.) We stopped eating meals together. The big round dining table with the lazy Susan became a piece of furniture in a showroom. Mercifully, it was just when our family had atomized into our own miserable corners of private eating  —   me with my unobtrusive bowls of cereal, my sister with her microwaveable cheese and broccoli Hot Pockets, my mom with whatever leftovers grandma left, my dad with his columns of saltines  —   that we discovered Souplantation. Souplantation! Where to begin. The colors, the smells, the cheerful clatter of communal eating. We went there on weekend afternoons, just the four of us. My parents, giddy with freedom, piled their plates like canvases. Spinach green with mottled iceberg, a splatter of carrots, a drizzle of creamy white. My sister and I often skipped the salads  —   unless it involved chicken or tuna  —   and went straight to the beef chili and clam chowder. We ate baked potatoes as a platform for eating bacon. We ate towers of soft serve with gummy bears. We ate until the effort it took to eat made it possible to eat more. ”Only three plates?” My parents would say. ”Let’s get our money’s worth.” We leaned back, we did squats, we made room. Souplantation was our family room. For once, we didn’t have to exercise our compassion. Well, we did. We were exercising compassion for ourselves. In the last few years, my dad has slowly resumed eating meat. He cited some study about older men and protein and the risk of getting a flat butt. In his 60s, he needs to start thinking more seriously about his health, he said. This instinct for   is also new and cheering. It seems like a reassertion of life, of the right to exist vigorously. And now that my grandparents have both passed, he’s come back to live in California again, reunited with my mom. They run the house the way they like. On weekends, after a stroll in the Arcadia Arboretum, they go to Souplantation together. It seems they’ve entered another phase of adulthood, one that finds them, finally, on top of the food chain. The last time I was home, I watched my dad nibble a piece of pork like a rabbit would a carrot. It made me incredibly happy.

2016-06-19,"  A Pennsylvania man faces charges including sexual assault after police say they found him living with 12 girls, including an    and two children he fathered with her. Police in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, just north of Philadelphia, arrested Lee Kaplan, 51, on Thursday. Police said the girls living with Kaplan at his house ranged in age from 6 months to 18 years. In a related case, authorities nearly 100 miles away in Lancaster County arrested the parents of the    with police saying the couple had ”gifted” their daughter to Kaplan for helping them out of financial difficulties. She was 14 when her first child was conceived, the criminal complaint said. Kaplan was charged with statutory sexual assault, corruption of minors, aggravated indecent assault, indecent assault and unlawful contact with a minor, according to a police criminal complaint filed in Bucks County.   The   ’s parents, Daniel and Savilla Stoltzfus of Quarryville, are charged with endangering the welfare of children. Daniel Stoltzfus also faces charges of criminal conspiracy and statutory sexual assault, according to a criminal complaint filed by police in Bucks County. Bucks County District Attorney David Heckler told CNN on Sunday that the Stoltzfuses claimed to be the parents of 10 of the girls, and the grandparents of the remaining two children. The couple are former members of the Amish religion, according to court documents.  Kaplan and Daniel and Savilla Stoltzfus are being held on $1 million bail in the Bucks County Correctional Facility, according to court dockets. CNN has not been able to reach attorneys for either the Stoltzfuses or Kaplan. The girls have been kept together in the care of county social services workers, Heckler said. Neighbor complaint gets police attention, Officers from the Lower Southampton Police Department said they responded to the small white home on Old Street in the Feasterville community on a tip from a neighbor. Neighbor Jen Betz told CNN she had contacted authorities multiple times about the situation. ”My gut was telling me to confirm what I was thinking. I just knew. There was no reason why this older, significantly older man, any man, regardless of what they look like, would have this amount of children, all in blue dresses, never outside the house regularly, looking so scared,” she said. ”I knew that something wasn’t right.” Kaplan had told neighbors that no children lived with him, according to the complaint. In his booking photo, Kaplan appears with long gray hair and an unkempt beard. He is the owner of Kaplan Precision Machine Company, according to state corporation filings.  ”I really can’t believe it, because I really thought it was his own daughter,” an unidentified neighbor told CNN affiliate KYW, referring to the   . ”It looks like his own daughter to me.” Other neighbors told the affiliate the girls didn’t go to school and were rarely let outside. According to police affidavits, Daniel and Savilla Stoltzfus ”came to an agreement” to give Kaplan their daughter after Daniel Stoltzfus ”researched the legality of it on the Internet,” the affidavit says. ”Stoltzfus stated that his daughter . .. was ’gifted’ to Lee Kaplan in thanks for helping his family out of financial ruin,” the affidavit continues. Authorities were told by Savilla Stoltzfus that she could produce birth certificates for the 10 older girls, Heckler said. Authorities had not yet obtained birth certificates on Sunday, he said, adding that any such documents and medical tests would determine whether the girls are in fact all the children or grandchildren of the couple. The district attorney said the investigation is ongoing and, ”We don’t know what we have.”"
2016-06-20,"ORLANDO, Fla.  —   As doctors treated the horrific injuries of victims shot in the Pulse nightclub massacre here, a mistaken report of a gunman nearby forced officials to briefly lock down the emergency room the medical staff shoved heavy   machines against the doors, creating a makeshift barricade in a treatment bay. Emergency room physicians ran low on tubes needed to reinflate the lungs of patients shot in the chest. The doctors scrambled to make sense of gunshot wounds because paramedics had rushed victims in with no time to assess their conditions. The hospital’s emergency preparedness manager, asleep at home, received an urgent email but did not respond until awakened by text. But of the 44 patients brought to Orlando Regional Medical Center with   gunshot wounds in the early hours of June 12, 35 survived. The Pulse nightclub massacre has put Orlando on a growing roster of places  —   Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Newtown, Paris, San Bernardino  —   forced to confront attacks with injuries comparable to those in war zones. More will become clear over time, but Orlando’s response is already beginning to provide lessons on the challenges, large and small, of dealing with mass shootings, as well as what went right and what went wrong, what can be anticipated and what cannot. And it is raising hard questions about how to act when medical priorities and law enforcement ones can seem to be at odds. Across the nation, and the world, the realization that mass killings are the new normal has been gradually sinking in. On Friday, the National Academy of Medicine in Washington published a discussion paper  —   titled “Health and Medical Response to Active Shooter and Bombing Events”  —   that details best practices to help communities become better prepared. It warns that many are ill equipped for a “surge in major trauma cases. ” Orlando, a major tourist destination, had worked hard to prepare. In March, Orlando Regional Medical Center, the only major trauma center in Central Florida, staged a realistic,   “active shooter scenario” simulating a school massacre that had left 500 wounded. Fifty agencies, including the F. B. I. participated in the   exercise. High school students in ghastly makeup flooded 15 hospitals. The Pulse shooting  —   which killed 49 and wounded 53  —   turned the March drill into a     reality for scores of doctors, nurses, hospital administrators, paramedics and pathologists. Wrenching questions remain: Could more lives have been saved if the police had stormed the nightclub earlier? Did terrified victims bleed to death waiting for help to arrive? The Orlando experience validated what experts in emergency medicine had long known: The faster victims can reach the hospital, the more likely they are to survive. Of the 49 victims, just nine died in the trauma center  —   and they died minutes after arriving, hospital officials said, which suggests they had been mortally wounded. The Pulse survivors owe their lives in part to a grim coincidence: The trauma center is just a few blocks from the nightclub. Given that, Orlando may not be a perfect model for what could happen elsewhere. “Because of the proximity, we felt that more lives had been saved than if it were anywhere else,” said Eric Alberts, the hospital’s emergency preparedness manager. Mr. Alberts, 39, who previously ran emergency operations at Disney World, said the active shooter drill in March, which he organized, had proved “very similar” to the Pulse massacre. Even so, said Dr. William S. Havron, a trauma surgeon who spent the night operating on victims, “I don’t think anybody can ever be fully prepared for something like this. ” Dr. Chris Hunter, an emergency room physician and the director of the health services department for Orange County, Fla. which includes Orlando, was on an overnight shift at a hospital 20 miles away when he received a text that thrust him into supervising the response. He made a fast decision: Orlando Regional Medical Center was going to Status Black. That designation meant the trauma center’s emergency room would be closed to all but the shooting victims and others with serious injuries. People with sprains, sore throats or earaches would be sent elsewhere. “We never do that,” Dr. Hunter said. Outside Pulse, about 80 paramedics were furiously trying to cope with the carnage. Working with two cellphones and a   radio because he could not leave his nighttime post, Dr. Hunter tried to track the paramedics to let the emergency room know when the next patients would arrive.   ambulances were making round trips. Paramedics usually radio ahead to the emergency room with each patient’s condition so doctors can prepare. But at Pulse, there was not always time for that. And the police and bystanders were also driving victims to the hospital. “It was great for the patients, but hard on the staff,” said Dr. Gary A. Parrish, the director of the emergency department. Dr. Havron, the trauma surgeon, had just drifted off to sleep after feeding his    son when he received the call. When he arrived at the emergency room, he could not enter it was locked down with the mistaken report of a gunman. He called a colleague, who told him to go upstairs to the operating room. Dr. Havron performed six operations that night. Experts know that good communication is critical in managing a crisis. But as more patients arrived, many unconscious and without identification, Mr. Alberts, the emergency preparedness manager, missed his first alert about the Pulse shooting, an email at 2:21 a. m. he was at home asleep. “That was one of the glitches we found that didn’t really work too well,” he said. It was not until 3:42 a. m. that he was awakened by a text from his boss. On Mr. Alberts’s orders, the hospital activated an emergency plan, moving patients around to make room for victims in the intensive care unit. Supervising the response from a command center, he confronted other challenges, not life or death, but still vexing. A   donor sent 50 pizzas Mr. Alberts had them thrown out, fearing a terrorist’s poison. Foreign consuls showed up, demanding a list of patients’ names that could not legally be released he politely referred the consuls to the State Department. Digital fingerprinting failed to identify an unconscious patient an   inkpad worked. Casualties came to the hospital that night in two waves, the first around 2 a. m. shortly after the shooting started. The second wave, victims who had been trapped in the club with the gunman, arrived around 5 a. m. after the police had blasted through a wall in the club and killed him. Dr. Havron and five other trauma surgeons at the hospital performed 28 operations that night. Of the 44 patients brought to the trauma center, eight died in the emergency room within minutes of their arrival, another died on the way to the operating room and 35 were admitted. As of Sunday, four remained in critical condition. “Everybody that made it to the operating room is still alive,” Dr. Havron said. But Dr. Jay Falk, the academic chairman of emergency medicine at the trauma center, warned that if there had been twice as many casualties, they might have overwhelmed the system. This is a problem the hospital will have to address, he said, adding, “We have to rethink that. ” Across town, at Florida Hospital Orlando, victims with less serious injuries began arriving around 3 a. m. Eventually there would be 12 of them. Most had been shot in the arms or the legs one had been trampled. The patients were awake and stable, and F. B. I. agents were eager to question them. Lorinda Stahley, the nurse manager for the emergency department, approached the victims gingerly. But, she said, “They were all ready and willing to be interviewed. ” Four needed surgery. Dr. Brian Vickaryous, an orthopedist and former Army surgeon who operated on combat injuries in Iraq, performed the operations. Each bullet he pulled out went to the F. B. I. Angel Santiago, 32, of Philadelphia, was one of his patients. Mr. Santiago had been trapped in a bathroom in the club, lying in a pool of blood. He had been shot in the legs he could see a bullet hole in the chest of his friend, who was sweating profusely. The two grew weaker as they waited, desperately, for the police to arrive. “By the time I got to the hospital, they said my blood pressure was very low,” Mr. Santiago said. “I was dizzy, cold they gave me two units of blood to try to stabilize me. ” He later learned that his friend, sent to another hospital  —   presumably Orlando Regional Medical Center  —   was in critical condition. He survived. Of the 50 who died, including the gunman, 39 died inside the club. Two more were found on the street outside. Those numbers, along with accounts like Mr. Santiago’s, raise agonizing questions about whether more lives could have been saved if the standoff had ended sooner, and whether some victims had bled slowly to death. Dr. Vickaryous, like many medical professionals here, did not want to   law enforcement. “We have a saying in medicine: ‘The    is  . ’” he said. The dead were brought to the Orange County morgue, which upgraded its capacity in 2010 to store as many as 150 bodies, with a plane crash or a tornado in mind. Dr. Joshua D. Stephany, the county medical examiner, supervised the autopsies and performed some himself. “I don’t think anyone had prolonged suffering,” he said in an interview. Autopsy reports could help explain how victims died, by describing the wounds. But no details have been released because the investigation is in progress. Analysis of bullets like the ones Dr. Vickaryous removed from victims may eventually answer another difficult question: whether some people were caught in the crossfire and shot by the police, said Dr. Jan Garavaglia, Dr. Stephany’s predecessor. The response to the massacre is already generating debate in academia. Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said there was little doubt that more of the injured would have survived if they had been rescued sooner. But he also urged against judging the police, because the gunman had boasted that he had bombs and accomplices. Both claims were lies, but no one could be sure at first. As to whether victims had died quickly or suffered, it depends on where the bullets hit, Dr. Redlener said. Here in Orlando, officials are just beginning to evaluate their response, even as they continue to care for patients, plan funerals and tend to their own emotional trauma. Mr. Alberts, the emergency preparedness manager, has had two debriefings with his medical team. At the Orlando Fire Department, Chief Roderick S. Williams, who supervised many of the paramedics first on the scene, is planning to “tell others our lessons learned. ” Fire chiefs from New York Aurora, Colo. and Boston  —   cities that have also confronted traumas  —   have already reached out to share their information. “As the next city to experience a horrific event like this,” Chief Williams said, “we have to pay it forward. ”"
2016-06-21,"Two more southern California fires sprung up on Monday, burning over 5, 000 acres in the San Gabriel Mountains by Tuesday morning and raising the total number of firefighters battling the state’s six active wildfires to over 4, 700.

2016-06-22," Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will seek   to his U. S. Senate seat, he announced on Wednesday, reversing a pledge not to run and saying the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency worries him. The   Florida senator said the Senate can be frustrating, but that it is also a place where policy advances can be made and one that can counteract the power of the White House. ”But as we begin the next chapter in the history of our nation, there’s another role for the Senate that could end up being its most important in the years to come: The Constitutional power to act as a check and balance on the excesses of a president,” Rubio said in a statement. The    lawmaker, a proven   who is well known nationally, had been under intense pressure to run, especially given the cost of contesting an important election   where campaign advertising is expensive. Republicans are more likely to retain his seat if he is a candidate in the Nov. 8 general election, as they face a tough fight to preserve their majority in the Senate. He could also rally Republican voters to head to the polls in a state that is critical in the presidential race. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, took Florida by just a one   margin in 2012 over Republican Mitt Romney. This year, Republicans must defend 24 of the 54 seats they now hold in the   Senate, compared with just 10 the Democrats have to fight to retain. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it would be a ”terrific outcome” if Rubio decided to run.  Rubio had harsh words for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, predicting her election would mean four more years of what he termed Obama’s ”failed” policies. TRUMP ’WORRISOME’ But he said the prospect of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the White House was also ”worrisome,” citing Trump’s statements about women and minorities and noting that many of the likely Republican nominee’s positions on important issues are unknown. ”If he is elected, we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him,” Rubio’s statement said. Still, he pledged to vote for Trump, a real estate mogul and political neophyte who has shaken the Republican establishment.  ”It’s not the choice I wanted . .. and it’s not the choice a lot of people are comfortable with, but it’s the choice we have,” he told CNN in an interview. His announcement did not mention the massacre last week at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, but he had said in recent days he was reconsidering his decision not to run because of his concern about serious events in the country, including the mass shooting. The decision reversed a campaign pledge Rubio made a year ago to retire from the Senate if his presidential bid failed. He ended his bid for the nomination in March after losing the primary in his home state to Trump following a harsh war of words. The Cook Political Report said Rubio’s announcement ”breathed new life” into Republican chances of holding onto the seat but still rated the race as a   citing his poor Senate attendance record and the senator’s remarks during his presidential campaign that he was ”frustrated” with the upper chamber. Republican U. S. Representative David Jolly, who had been seeking the Senate seat, opened the door for Rubio to run when he stepped aside last week.  After Wednesday’s announcement, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera, a friend of Rubio, and Republican U. S. Representative Ron DeSantis also scrapped plans to seek the seat. Other Republicans, however, have not announced plans to quit ahead of Florida’s Aug. 30 primary. U. S. Representative Patrick Murphy, a leading Democratic challenger, accused Rubio of first abandoning his constituents, and now ”treating them like a consolation prize.”  (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Kouichi Shirayanagi; Writing by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Jonathan Oatis) MEXICO CITY A meeting between Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and U. S. President Donald Trump on Friday at the G20 summit in Germany will last about 30 minutes and probably not lead to any major agreements, Mexico’s foreign minister said on Wednesday. NEW YORK The U. S. government on Wednesday proposed reducing the volumes of biofuel required to be used in gasoline and diesel in 2018, in a move that could mark the first step toward a broader overhaul to the controversial energy policy. "
2016-06-23,"  Donald Trump’s   speech attacking Hillary Clinton Wednesday seemed more designed to reassure the candidate’s Republican base than to broaden his appeal to independents or Democrats.   The fact is Trump raised valid questions about Clinton’s foreign policy positions,   practices and email quandary    but he did so in his vintage    fashion, with so many personal insults that many will ignore or forget the substance of his criticism. For example, it’s one thing to question the Obama administration’s foreign policy, and quite another to leap to Trump’s overheated conclusion: ”The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars    and unleashed ISIS across the world.  No secretary of state has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton. Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.” Everywhere?  The statement cries out for a more substantive debate about Clinton’s support for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden the temporary ceasefire she negotiated between Hamas and Israel and the Iran nuclear deal.  But Trump’s speech wasn’t about debating policy points, it was an   trashing of Clinton designed to rally conservatives, predictably veered off the road from justifiable concerns into unfounded conspiracy theories.  Indeed, Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state, and donations to the Clinton Foundation raise important questions about potential conflicts of interest that the campaign has not fully answered.  But that’s a long way from stating, as Trump did, that ”to   her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server,” or that ”While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do. So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.”   A more rational reading of Trump’s accusations would have to acknowledge that Trump’s repeated assertion that Clinton belongs behind bars is just false    and Republicans know it.  Paul Waldman wrote in The Washington Post earlier this spring that many of the emails deemed ”classified” were only done so by intelligence agencies after they were sent. Because she didn’t knowingly and intentionally send state secrets on an unsecure server, there isn’t really much of a case to lead her away in handcuffs to a federal courtroom.  As for the substance of the 296 emails rolled out by the State Department last May, roughly a dozen were from Sidney Blumenthal   a writer, lobbyist and longtime Clinton ally   sent to Clinton’s email account during her time as top diplomat, and they have also raised eyebrows.   Blumenthal was barred from working for the State Department in 2009 because he regularly blasted Barack Obama during the 2008 election. But that didn’t stop him from regularly lobbying Clinton with information about who could head a new government in Libya, suggestions that she recirculated to her staff, according to reporting from the New York Times.  Blumenthal’s communications with Clinton raised a string of ethical questions. He represented a company looking to land contracts in Libya after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi, and The New York Times reported he was being paid by The Clinton Foundation.  And Bill Clinton’s   has been a headache for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The Clinton Foundation has pulled in millions from foreign nationals, has suffered from embarrassing security lapses. The New York Times reported in April 2015 that the   took in money from a Canadian group of investors that was in the process of selling off its shares of a uranium company to Russia. The company’s chairman gave $2. 35 million to the Clinton Foundation through his own family foundation, in four donations, as the firm, Uranium One, was sold to Russian officials between 2009 and 2013.  Then Secretary of State Clinton had to sign off on the sale. The Clintons didn’t disclose those donations    an apparent departure from an agreement she had made with Obama to do so, according to the Times report. That’s just one of several questionable relationships between the Clintons and donors.  The Clinton Global Initiative, a   charitable organization (and spinoff of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation) in 2010 helped arrange a $2 million commitment from a Canadian businesswoman and CGI member to invest in a   company owned by Clinton friends, according to a Wall Street Journal article last month. That year, Bill Clinton lobbied   of Energy Steven Chu for a grant the Department of Energy gave the company an $812, 000 grant, the article said. Then there’s the story of Rajiv K. Fernando, a   securities trader who was a fundraiser and donor to The Clinton Foundation. Fernando wound up getting himself a seat on the State Department’s International Security Advisory Board    giving him access to highly classified materials    despite the fact that he didn’t have any background in foreign affairs, ABC News reported last week. Other board members started to become concerned in 2011 when Fernando didn’t seem to know anything about nuclear security and one member told ABC: ”We had no idea who he was.” Clinton officials have tried to dodge some of these questionable donations and suggestions as to what those contributions might have purchased. But voters deserve to question the schmoozing and fundraising that gets spun into nothing more than a mix up.  So Trump has good, valid reasons to warn voters about Clinton’s record.  But unfounded suggestions that she could be blackmailed go a step too far.  So does Trump’s assertion in his speech that ”Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.” Researchers can find no support for Trump’s assertion that he was a   opponent of the Iraq War the   at Politifact rate the claim as false.  What’s left is the kind of     bombast Trump has been serving up from the podium for a year now.    love it, but it’s hard to see how it will change minds in the swing states likely to settle the election in November. Correction: An earlier version of this commentary incorrectly described the relationship between the Clinton Global Initiative and Energy Pioneer Solutions.  The company did not commit $2 million to the Clinton Global Initiative CGI helped arrange the commitment of $2 million from another party to Energy Pioneer Solutions, according to a Wall Street Journal article.

2016-06-24,"London  It was a string of steady arguments that built support behind the ”Leave” campaign, organizers and backers of that successful effort said Friday. READ: What does Brexit mean for you? Celebrating the Leave victory, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who was at the forefront of campaigning for Brexit, told a group of journalists that the EU is ”dying.” He says the UK has now given itself ”the chance to rejoin the world . .. June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.” ”I was written off as being a lunatic and politically the support for this was absolutely tiny,” Farage told CNN Friday. ”(It was) a little idea that was considered a little kooky, and 17 million voted for it and I couldn’t be happier.” Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, hailed the Brexit victory and reassured those who voted to remain that there was no need to panic: ”This does not mean that the United Kingdom will be in any way less united, nor indeed does it mean that it will be any less European.” ’Noble idea . .. no longer right for this country’ While the UK has always had an arm’  relationship with the EU since it joined in 1973, the Leave campaign has consistently argued the UK has paid too much to be a part of the Union and that the country is being pressured by rules and regulations set by Brussels.  READ: The   guide to Brexit  After the announcement that the Leave campaign won, Johnson reiterated: ”There is simply no need in the 21st century to be part of a federal government in Brussels that is imitated nowhere else on Earth. It was a noble idea for its time but it is no longer right for this country.” While Prime Minister David Cameron fought for a ”special status” that exempts the UK from many of the EU laws, Johnson warned in May that the EU was the latest manifestation of a   project to unify Europe under a single government. ”Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically,” Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph. ”The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods.” Farage said the move will give the UK ”greater influence as an independent country . .. We’ll make our laws in our own parliament, in our own supreme court and control our own borders.” For those unsure that Brexit is the right decision, Johnson reiterated it wasn’t entirely a goodbye to Europe: ”Britain will continue to be a great European power, leading discussions on defense and foreign policy and the work that goes on to make our world safer.” Goodbye to an open door immigration policy, During the campaign, the Leave supporters focused heavily on immigration. They argued that free movement in the EU meant Britain loses control of its borders. EU membership allowed citizens from the other 27 countries to move to Britain and look for work without a concrete job offer.  ”Leave” supporters pointed to immigrants from struggling Eastern European states who were willing to work for low wages in their arguments about getting out of the EU.  ”The introduction of the EU passport, whilst a good idea (because) it allows nice people to travel easily around the continent, what it also does is allow bad people to travel freely across the continent,” Farage said. READ: What will immigration look like if Britain? British Home Secretary Theresa May said free movement in the EU ”makes it harder to control immigration.”   campaigners have suggested the UK establish an ”    immigration system.” The idea is that those who have certain skills and qualifications that are worth more to the British economy will gain more ”points,” which will help them reach a threshold that allows them to become eligible for a visa. Whatever the future policy may be, there will be no change for EU citizens already lawfully residing in the country. ”These EU citizens will automatically be granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK and will be treated no less favorably than they are at present,” Vote Leave said. What happens now? Going forward, Farage told CNN his party ”needs to stay strong to make sure the government actually carries out the wishes of the people.” ”We’re going to watch these negotiations like a hawk,” he said. ”We’ve won the vote to become an independent nation, we now need to make sure it actually does happen.” For those who voted to remain in the EU, he had one message: ”Don’t worry.” ”I’d say to them, listen, our trading relationship today is exactly the same as it was yesterday. What we now have is a period of transition which we can get a sensible deal with our European neighbors,” Farage said. ”The exciting thing is we can do more globally and we are going to be better off as a result of this.”"
2016-06-25,"(Reuters)  —   Some of the web’s biggest destinations for watching videos have quietly started using automation to remove extremist content from their sites, according to two people familiar with the process. [The move is a major step forward for internet companies that are eager to eradicate violent propaganda from their sites and are under pressure to do so from governments around the world as attacks by extremists proliferate, from Syria to Belgium and the United States.  YouTube and Facebook are among the sites deploying systems to block or rapidly take down Islamic State videos and other similar material, the sources said. The technology was originally developed to identify and remove   content on video sites. It looks for “hashes,” a type of unique digital fingerprint that internet companies automatically assign to specific videos, allowing all content with matching fingerprints to be removed rapidly. Such a system would catch attempts to repost content already identified as unacceptable, but would not automatically block videos that have not been seen before. The companies would not confirm that they are using the method or talk about how it might be employed, but numerous people familiar with the technology said that posted videos could be checked against a database of banned content to identify new postings of, say, a beheading or a lecture inciting violence. The two sources would not discuss how much human work goes into reviewing videos identified as matches or   by the technology. They also would not say how videos in the databases were initially identified as extremist. Read the rest of the story at Reuters."
2016-06-26,"  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Sunday the Donald Trump campaign had not yet reached out to him about joining the ticket. Many have pointed Gingrich, who ran for president in 2012, as a potential running mate for the Republican presumptive nominee. The former speaker himself has not been shy about his interest in the spot. But according to his comments on ”Fox News Sunday,” Trump hasn’t come close to approaching him about it. ”Nobody’s called me. Nobody has said, ’Would you like to be?’ Nobody has said, ’Would you be willing to be considered?’ Nobody has said anything,” Gingrich said. Corker on Trump: Scotland ’one of his best events’ Gingrich said the lack of contact about the vice presidency was not a sign he was out of contention. The Georgia Republican said he thinks Trump will not decide on a running mate until right before the party’s nominating convention.  ”(Trump’s) probably going to start thinking about it about two days before Cleveland,” Gingrich said. ”I think that Donald Trump does not want to make a decision until the convention.” When the time comes for Trump to decide, Gingrich said the vetting process in his case would be simple because of how long he has been in the public eye.  ”In the case of a few of us, there’s not much vetting to do,” Gingrich said. ”It’s all out there. All you’ve got to do is Google.”"
2016-06-27,"During his appearance on Breitbart News Sunday, Stephen Miller, senior policy adviser to Donald Trump, finds Big Media’s coverage of the Brexit vote as unsatisfactory as its coverage of the U. S. presidential campaign. He cited CNN’s coverage of Trump’s major speech last week as an example. [“Mr. Trump did a speech recently, laying out some of the most important facts from the book Clinton Cash, and also drawing some linkages between Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street ties and some of her trade decisions,” Miller told SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon. “I think that CNN has an obligation to talk about what these trade deals have done to our working class, and to make Hillary Clinton answer for her support for NAFTA, her support for China, her support for normalizing trade relations with Vietnam, her support for the TPP, her support for the Korean deal, her support for the Columbia deal  —   shall I go on?”  “Now, on the point about Brexit, the people of Britain, as Mr. Trump said, have chosen to declare their independence  —   to reassert control over their trade deals, over their immigration policies, and over all domestic procedures. And now he’s calling on Americans to do the same thing for their own country,” Miller continued. Noting that the Trump campaign has been meeting with evangelical leaders, Bannon asked if religious conservatives have lost most of their influence in Washington because “there are many evangelicals out there that just decided, hey, I don’t want to get involved politics. ” “The evangelical movement in America has been, arguably, one of the most engaged political communities that we have,” Miller replied. “And oftentimes up against really extraordinary odds  —   a media class that mocks and demeans people of faith, and a political class that is not attuned to their concerns, and often pushes an agenda counter to their concerns. Obviously, a good example of that would be ObamaCare. ”  “So we need to have all of our voters, including our evangelical voters and our Catholic voters, engage  —   and what are we going to do? We’re going to repeal ObamaCare, which we know has been a major point of concern for communities of faith. We’re going to appoint judges who are going to support our Constitution, and the protection it affords, to people of faith. And we’re not going to get wrapped up in global financial institutions that put the altar of world GDP above the concerns of people of faith, and Christian people, in our own country,” Miller said. Immigration control was a major topic in the Brexit campaign, and of course it has been a big part of Trump’s presidential campaign, giving Miller another opportunity to draw a parallel. He noted that in Trump’s New York City speech last Wednesday, he “talked about the effect that Hillary Clinton’s immigration plan was going to have on working people in general, and poor Hispanics and   in particular, and framing it in explicitly economic terms and    terms. ” “If you look at what was successful for Brexit, it was that same thing  —   understanding immigration as an issue of    and your ability to have control over resources and your community, and to have some semblance of upward mobility,” Miller said. He praised Breitbart News for getting involved early with issues that other media outlets tended to downplay or ignore. “You did Breitbart London, and you brought Nigel Farage to the United States,” he recalled. “You hosted a dinner, I was privileged enough to be at it. I remember because I was working for Jeff Sessions at the time, and he was seated right next to Nigel, and he talked about what he was going to do in the UK and how many believed that would be possible. And I share that only to say  —   it’s going to sound like a motivational speech, but it’s true  —   to all the voters out there: the only limits to what we can achieve is what we believe we can achieve. ” Miller addressed criticism of Trump’s journey to the Turnberry golf course in Scotland, on the eve of the Brexit vote, by picturing it as a symbolic rejection of attacks against his business record. “He went there to support his son, and also it was a chance to talk about Brexit in the United Kingdom,” said Miller. “It’s funny how Hillary Clinton and others try and diminish Donald Trump’s business record, and yet he has just acquired the most important piece of property that’s undeveloped in Washington, D. C.  —   the old Post Office building. He’s acquired one of the most historic, magical golf courses on the face of the Earth. He has the most iconic piece of property in the New York City skyline, and one of them in the Chicago skyline, and all across the country. So it really is a testament to his skills as a businessman. ” He anticipated that Trump’s promised series of major policy speeches will present a sharp contrast with Hillary Clinton  —   “the difference between the darkest of nights and the brightest of dawns. ” Bannon brought up a series of damaging revelations against Clinton over the past few weeks, including the confirmation that Clinton destroyed official emails, in defiance of sworn statements to the contrary edited her official calendar as Secretary of State to conceal politically inconvenient meetings with   donors and arranged for an unqualified donor to sit on an important national security council.  “It’s hard to get your head around corruption on that kind of global scale,” said Miller. “It’s interesting, Hillary Clinton is not only a globalist, she’s also involved in global international corruption. It’s one thing to be an economic globalist and pursue policies to the detriment of the American people. It’s a whole other thing to be engaged in a scheme of international global corruption to personally and financially profit from selling out America. ” “The level of effort that she went to, to conceal her activities  —   everything you just mentioned, and also the work on, of course, the private email server, which put every American at risk  —   obviously demonstrates a guilty conscience,” he continued. “In other words, you don’t try and hide foreign donations, and meetings with donors, and all of your emails, if everything you’re doing is  . That is so   and so obvious to anybody, that I think it would be impossible for a reasonable person to deny that statement. ” He added that the real reason Clinton deleted almost 30, 000 emails, ostensibly because they were personal communications unrelated to her job as Secretary of State, “is almost certainly to cover up the corrupt dealings that are documented in Clinton Cash and elsewhere. ” “You cannot elevate someone to the presidency who has not only been engaged in documented widespread international corruption, but then has engaged in a systematic effort, at the expense of U. S. national security, to delete, hide, and conceal the records of said corruption,” Miller declared. “That would just be unimaginable, to take somebody involved in that kind of behavior  —   which, again, has put every single American at risk  —   and then give them a promotion. ” Bannon asserted that the primary purpose of Clinton’s homebrew email server was to thwart Freedom of Information Act requests from groups like Judicial Watch and Citizens United  —   which seem much more interested in filing FOIA requests against Clinton and the Obama Administration than   “good government” groups that were active during Republican administrations. “The irony is that Hillary Clinton has found whole new ways to get special interests involved in politics and to corrupt our political system with money,” Miller pointed out. “At least other politicians simply rely on campaign contributions when it comes to quid pro quo. Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton actually got rich themselves doing it, putting money in their own personal pockets. Bill Clinton gives some speech somewhere, all have business in front of the State Department, Hillary Clinton renders a favorable decision, and then they pocket the cash. ” “Where is Chuck Schumer or Harry Reid?” he asked, referring to Democrat politicians who often complain about the nefarious influence of money in politics. “I think you would be   to find an example in American history of a politician who had engaged in more questionable ethical financial dealings than Hillary Clinton  —   and that is the politest way possible to put it. ” Miller said it was significant that Trump’s first major campaign speech against Clinton focused so heavily upon corruption. “That will be a major theme moving forward,” he promised. “At the end of the day, I don’t think that the American people are going to promote somebody who not only engaged in enterprise corruption, but who engaged in enterprise corruption in order to make herself wealthy at the expense of the country. ” “It’s not just extraordinary corruption. It’s extraordinary corruption for the purpose of hurting America,” Miller said. Breitbart News Sunday airs from 7 p. m. to 10 p. m. Eastern time on Sirius XM Patriot Channel 125. LISTEN:  "
2016-06-28,"Hillary Clinton put forward a set of proposals, in a newly released agenda on technology and innovation, that would treat entrepreneurs and startup workers more favorably than other student debtors. In a move aimed at “breaking down barriers and leveling the playing field for entrepreneurs and innovators who are launching their own startups” Clinton proposed allowing startup founders to defer student debt payment for up to three years. The deferrals would also be available to a new company’s first 10 to 20 employees.  The student debt proposals are just one facet of a broad platform aimed at promoting the tech industry, but they drew immediate backlash on Twitter, where users asked why entrepreneurs should receive special treatment.  Clinton has proposed several ways to lower college debt for American students, but creating a program specifically targeted at benefitting tech workers carries political risks. Fairly or unfairly, the industry has become associated with the   class and white men, not the most sympathetic recipients of government aid programs.  Additionally, Clinton proposes student loan forgiveness of up to $17, 500 after five years for “young innovators” who either launch a new businesses in “distressed communities” or “social enterprises that provide measurable social impact and benefit”. “It’s bad. 6 mo ago HRC fought free college   it privileged the wealthy,” tweeted Troy Nichols, who said he both worked in tech and has student debt. “This does that explicitly. ”  “What about artists?” tweeted actress Zoe Kazan. “Please think about forgiving debts for young people in art   careers in the arts  …     so that people who do not come from privileged backgrounds (  parents, like mine, who could pay for college) can also afford to make art. ” The cost of college and student debt was a fraught issue during the Democratic primary, in which   and   college was a key (and popular) part of Bernie Sanders’ campaign.  “It doesn’t add up, my friends,” she said of Sanders’ proposals. Or, as she put it more caustically in a Democratic debate, “I disagree with free college for everybody. I don’t think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump’s kids to college. ” Clinton’s proposal for college education states that students should be able to attend a   public college in their state without debt through a combination of Pell Grants, “affordable and realistic” family contributions, and     work requirements.  The education department already offers some loan forgiveness programs, but they’re considered paltry by global standards.  For instance, teachers can get up to $17, 500 forgiven if they teach five consecutive years at a public elementary or high school and meet other conditions. Government and some    workers can get their balance forgiven on some federal student loans if they make 120   monthly payments. Most American college graduates would be approaching their   by that point.  The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "
2016-06-29,"Wednesday on CNN’s “New Day,” former CNN and Al Jazeera regular Ali Velshi and the chairman of the American Conservative Union and former White House political director for George W. Bush Matt Schlapp debated presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s trade policy and ISIS strategy on comparison to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s proposals.  Schlapp said of Hillary Clinton, “I don’t know how she tells the American people that she has a strategy on radical Islamic terrorism, because she was President Obama secretary of state. She owns the last seven years. ” Partial transcript as follows: SCHLAPP:  Look, poll after poll, including the poll that shows him trailing Hillary Clinton the most, shows him on the question of will he have the leadership to destroy ISIS, he has the most commanding lead over Hillary Clinton. There is something about the guy where he connects to voters on the fact that they feel, I think this is true in America today, they feel we lack leadership, a true understanding of what’s going on in the war against Islamic terror. CUOMO: Trump says, I’ll be Strong is that enough? VELSHI: The generalities make him seem strong, but again, as you just talked to others about the specificity helps here, some troops on the ground, that’s what a lot of people are calling for. The fact, is we are showing that what we’ve got there, 5, 000, 6, 000 troops, Mosul will be tougher in getting into Syria, will be next to impossible because they don’t want the Americans there. We have to think about this in a sophisticated manner. You have to weaken their infrastructure and got to their finances. That is something that the  —   our allies in the region can be most helpful for. The money they’re getting is coming from the region. We have to just be sophisticated about this. Saying generally we have to be tough, and this is bad while it appeals to people and it is visceral and I get that, is not a solution. Hillary Clinton could do with a little more detail about her plan how to do this as well. I think there is a middle ground. George W. Bush got that. It is very complicated. SCHLAPP: In all fairness to her as a candidate I don’t know how she tells the American people that she has a strategy on radical Islamic terrorism, because she was President Obama secretary of state. She owns the last seven years. CUOMO: So your suggestion is to write off any of the gains on the ground against ISIS. SCHLAPP: No, let’s be fair. Let’s give credit where credit is due. CUOMO:  You don’t hear anybody, Trump or anybody saying we’re winning on the ground in ISIS. SCHLAPP: I want them to win. I think these people want to destroy America and I want them to win. Here’s  —   I want America to be successful I wanted the president to succeed.  I wanted secretary to succeed when she was secretary of state. They fell on their face. What the American voter is saying in poll after poll —   they just don’t get the fact that we have to take these guys on. And it is not just ISIS, it wasn’t just al Qaeda, they’re coming in   in America. VELSHI: Let’s give credit where credit is due. Not understanding Iraq, I think that goes back to your administration. SCHLAPP: You want to make cheap shots go for it. VELSHI:  Everybody doesn’t understand it. It is complicated. I’m trying to say there are lots of people who don’t understand. this is really complicated. Donald Trump’s simple answers belie what the Bush administration didn’t know  —   why do you think he knows it better than two administrations over 16 years. SCHLAPP: For voters, this isn’t that hard. I think they’ll give the leader the benefit of the doubt that it is complicated and a big hairy problem of feeding this terrorist threat. It is a big problem. they want them to connect with the fact that they’re worried about it, that they’re scared about the future of the country, and when you can’t call the enemy what the enemy is, and when San Bernardino happened, you know what they did with the flags, they put them at half mass  they said it was workplace violence. The voters, they know what this is. These are terrorists among us. CUOMO: There has to be something what Matt is saying, because we’re seeing it in the polls. I get it  —   you have to take the next step. sometimes what people want to first be is consoled and you know emotionally where you are as their leader. That’s one issue. an issue that is not as emotional is how are you going to bring jobs back into the country. Everybody says they’re going to bring jobs back in every election. Yesterday, Trump gave a speech saying how he would do it. The critics are saying he never does it, shit up he did it yesterday. SCHLAPP: The biggest point is he is a businessman, he negotiates deals. He is sending a message to China and the rest of the world that fess the if he is the leader, he is going to negotiate much tougher deals. CUOMO: NAFTA will be gone, the current state of affairs. SCHLAPP: He will use the powers he has make sure he stands up for the American worker. CUOMO: Hold on one second. The speech he said, I’m going to get rid of the deal, change the deal  —   you went what’s that about. You endorsed the guy for president. SCHLAPP: I do. I’m saying what he is saying we have to go through a process where we get rid of the bad deals. it is more complicated than to say he is going to get rid of it. to renegotiate deals, the message is the right message. But let me tell you something else, manufacturing has left because maybe not a poorly executed deal, it is also because our regulatory environment and tax environment. We have the highest income taxes in the world. Hillary Clinton started  —   let me finish. VELSHI: You’ve been talking for a while. SCHLAPP: I’m almost done, buddy. She wanted to raise those income taxes. that’s not going to create any jobs. CUOMO: Use your time to make points. You say there were some dishonest premises. VELSHI: First of all, again the people that wanted NAFTA was the Bush administration. they negotiated, and couldn’t get it finished. He talked about bringing jobs back that are lost because of low wages, a third of our jobs, if not more in manufacturing have been lost to gains in productivity. We manufacture much much more in America than when Barack Obama became president. It is a bad situation, but we manufacture more with fewer workers, and they’re not getting paid as well. That’s reality. Are we going to undo technology? Are we going to start make things by hand?  …    Even I phones are made by robots  …    hold on. CUOMO: I’m enjoying the dynamic, I have to be honest. VELSHI: You couldn’t stop talking to me in the green room. SCHLAPP: If we don’t manufacture things in America, they are made someplace else in a dirtier fashion. And the fact is we’re not going to make everything here, but we can make a lot more here. We can’t be cavalier about jobs and turning them over to other countries and other sectors. I want to make as much as we can. We can’t make everything but  —   VELSHI: So when you start taking away these tariffs and start canceling these deals, how is it you think other people will buy your stuff? And your going to buy their stuff cheaply. SCHLAPP: Simple. how do you think American products can’t be made  —   VELSHI: TPP  lifts tariffs on 70% of the cars that go into Japan. That’s part of the negotiation, getting American product news places. Have you been to Vietnam? They do nothing but drive. They want cars, they’re all Japanese cars, because America can’t get them in. SCHLAPP:If you have a   agreement, they don’t need to be so big and complicated. And both economies, both markets should be freer. Unfortunately unfortunately, when we get done with these   agreements  the American economy is open to them and their economy stays closed. VELSHI: That’s just not true. SCHLAPP  It is factual. Look at Japan  …    Japan and Vietnam, where again, you don’t see  —   VELSHI: You’re wrong. SCHLAPP:  I’m not I don’t think —   VELSHI: Trade deals are not simple, Matt. They take ten years to negotiate. SCHLAPP: Japan is a closed economy at the end of TPP 10% will be opened to other products. The fact is, that’s not equitable. VELSHI:  Japan is one of the biggest economies in the world. CUOMO:  Let’s leave it there this was actually progress. I want you to know that in an election where all we’re hearing is crooked and no temperament for president, you’re going at the issues.

2016-06-30,"BRUSSELS  —   With Britain’s prime minister omitted for the first time, European Union leaders at a summit meeting wrestled on Wednesday with an existential question: how to salvage a venture that has provided peace and relative prosperity to 500 million people but has lost public support. “We all need to wake up and smell the coffee,” President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania said at the start of private talks in Brussels on how to relaunch the European Union after the shock of Britain’s vote last week to leave. In the absence of Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who was already back in London after attending an initial day of talks, the group’s remaining 27 leaders all agreed that the European Union needs to change the way it works if it is to curb a rising tide of populism driven in large part by hostility toward Brussels. Presenting the leaders with his own analysis of why 52 percent of Britons had voted to withdraw from the European Union, Mr. Cameron, at a somber dinner late Tuesday, said the main reason was immigration. Polls in other countries show deep opposition to an influx of foreigners. But reducing immigration, or at least the right of European Union citizens to move wherever they want in the bloc, is currently impossible, because the free movement of citizens is an inviolable principle of the whole European project. At the same time, slowing the flow of migrants from outside Europe is something that officials in Brussels consider a notable success. It took a long time and many meetings, but, under a controversial deal with Turkey, last year’s flood of nearly a million people into Europe through Greek islands has slowed to a trickle. Migrants are still arriving in Europe after hazardous journeys across the Mediterranean from North Africa, but they are far fewer than the number who arrived last year through Greece  —   the people used by campaigners in Britain to rally opposition to the European Union. With no easy fixes to Europe’s public image and no consensus on what a reformed union might look like, the main agreement reached on Wednesday was familiar: to hold another meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia, in September. In a final statement, the leaders acknowledged that the British referendum “creates a new situation for the European Union,” and that “many people express dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs. ” Europeans, they added, “expect us to do better when it comes to providing security, jobs and growth, as well as hope for a better future. ” Changing a complicated system that has three presidents, two seats of Parliament in cities hundreds of miles apart and, at least until Britain formally departs, 28 member countries, was never going to be decided in a few hours. “The response to this new challenge for Europe will take time to find,” Frans Timmermans, a former foreign minister of the Netherlands and the first vice president of the union’s executive arm, the European Commission, cautioned earlier this week. “We must be brutally honest with ourselves as we debate the path forward. Today, there are more questions than answers. ” François Lafond, a professor of European integration at Sciences Po, the Paris university, said the task of finding answers was so big that it should be entrusted to a special convention of experts and officials who would be given at least six months to create a new approach. Otherwise, “the populists will continue to grow,” he said. “We have to give a clear signal of change. ” A critical issue, Mr. Lafond said, is which functions should be returned to individual nations and which should fall within the powers of the union. Arguments over this division of labor have dogged the   European project since it began more than six decades ago in response to World War II, and have caused numerous crises. One of the most serious came in 1965, when President Charles de Gaulle of France objected to proposals from Brussels that he saw as weakening national sovereignty and pushing Europe toward becoming a giant state. Infuriated by what he viewed as an intolerable infringement, he pulled French officials from the Brussels institutions of what was then the European Economic Community. Their departure, a narrow, bureaucratic version of Britain’s, became known as the empty chair crisis. It was resolved, as most European crises have been, through   haggling and an elaborate compromise ensuring that France would retain its national   prerogatives on major issues. The crisis unleashed by the British vote, however, offers no bureaucratic fix, as it involves what have long been the European project’s most vulnerable points: its remoteness from ordinary people and lack of democratic legitimacy. The European Parliament, elected by popular vote since 1979, was meant to fill this gap. But given no power to actually introduce legislation, it is mostly seen as a noisy, expensive forum that merely approves measures proposed by the Commission. Perhaps the most significant role played by the European Parliament has been to provide a megaphone for some of the union’s most impassioned enemies, notably politicians from the U. K. Independence Party, or UKIP. The party  —   whose leader, Nigel Farage, and 23 followers hold seats in the assembly  —   campaigned fervently for Britain’s exit from the European Union. They and allies like Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, call the European Union a meddling and alien force, a message that has resounded elsewhere, particularly France. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s   National Front party, wants the nation to hold its own referendum. France’s deeply unpopular Socialist president, François Hollande, who is struggling to rescue his own political future as well as Europe’s, said on Wednesday that drastic change was needed. “Keeping the status quo would be the worst,” he said, “because populists would continue to challenge Europe. ” But many of the things Mr. Hollande and   European politicians want to see, such as more pooling of resources from shared European funds  —   are anathema to Germany, the dominant power on the Continent, which wants to enforce fiscal prudence but resists moving toward a federal state. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany shut the door on any overhaul involving the revision of European treaties, a laborious process that requires referendums and has often stoked   sentiment. Ms. Merkel said Europe needed to recover its élan and inspire ordinary citizens with an ambitious vision, as the United States did with its space program. “When Russia, many years ago, sent the first people into space, America said, ‘Now we have to send someone to the moon,’” Ms. Merkel said, citing an observation she said a fellow leader had made in private discussions. “So we have to set a positive agenda, positive goals, and try to show we have an ambition, an aspiration to produce prosperity for our people. ”"
2016-07-01,"CONCORD, Calif.  —   The owner of a California movie theater is apologizing after a trailer for an   upcoming Seth Rogen comedy was shown ahead of a screening of Disney’s “Finding Dory. ” The   moviegoers eager to see the   “Dory” at a Brenden theater in the Bay Area city of Concord were surprised earlier this month with a preview of Rogen’s “Sausage Party,” an animated film with dark themes about what happens to food after it’s taken home from the supermarket. Brenden vice president Walter Eichinger tells the newspaper it was a   mishap due to the theater “moving screens around in effort to accommodate several large   groups wanting to see ‘Dory. ’” He says the wrong movie was started by mistake and insists it won’t happen again."
2016-07-02,"A disabled teenage cancer patient was injured during a violent arrest by security agents at Memphis international airport, her family has alleged in a lawsuit filed against the Transport Security Administration. Hannah Cohen, 18, at the time of her arrest on 30 June 2015, and her mother had been on their way home to Chattanooga from St Jude’s hospital in Memphis, where Hannah underwent her final treatment for a brain tumor. Hannah and her mother, Shirley, told the Guardian that the pair had made the trip hundreds of times, and knew the airport security routine well. Shirley would usually go through the scanner first and wait for Hannah on the other side, since Hannah’s tumor, and numerous surgeries and treatments since she was two years old, had left her easily confused and frightened in unfamiliar situations.  According to the complaint, the warning alarm was triggered when Hannah passed through the body scanners. Hannah attributed the alarm to her shirt’s design. “My shirt  —   it had sequins,” Hannah told the Guardian, laboring to speak. According to the complaint: “You could see on the screen what it was pointing out,” Shirley said. She stood to the side, watching, wearing an immobilization boot on a broken foot. Agents told Hannah they needed to take her to a “sterile area” where they could search her further. She was afraid, Shirley said, and offered to take off the sequined shirt as she was wearing another underneath, but a female agent laughed at her. Seeing the scene begin to unfold, Shirley hobbled to a supervisor standing nearby. “She is a St Jude’s patient, and she can get confused,” she said. “Please be gentle. If I could just help her, it will make things easier. ” But soon, a voice on the public address system requested more agents to report to the checkpoint, Shirley said. “That’s when the armed guards came. ”  The brain tumor had left Hannah blind in one eye, deaf in one ear and partially paralyzed, so when the guards grabbed each of her arms, it startled her, she said. “I tried to push away,” she said. “I tried to get away. ” The guards slammed Hannah to the ground, her mother said, smashing her face into the floor, which the complaint alleges left her “physically and emotionally” injured. Shirley had just picked up her phone from the conveyor belt, and she snapped a photo of Hannah on the floor: handcuffed, weeping and bleeding.  “Another guard pushed me back 20ft, in my boot, and told me I couldn’t be nearby,” said Shirley, a professor of nursing at a university in Chattanooga.  “I felt so helpless. I sat down on a bench facing away so I couldn’t see what they were doing to my daughter. ” The lawsuit alleges that the TSA did not give Hannah adequate accommodation to screen her, and discriminated against her because of her disability. It names the TSA and the   County airport authority and seeks damages that include medical expenses and for personal injury, both physical and emotional. It calls for a “reasonable sum not exceeding $100, 000 and costs” and an undisclosed punitive amount.  The TSA has not yet responded to the complaint. Hannah disappeared behind a door, then went to a hospital, and finally to the Shelby County jail. After 24 hours apart, the mother and daughter were reunited in the parking lot of the jail. Shirley said she held her daughter, who sobbed, “I’m sorry, Mama. ” The next morning  —   now two days without their belongings, which had made the flight home  —   the pair appeared before a local judge, who asked the accused to explain herself.  When Hannah responded, the judge said: “You’re going to have to speak up. ” That’s when Hannah looked up and her hair fell back from her face, revealing her unseeing eye, surrounded by cuts and contusions.  “The judge’s eyes got big and round,” Shirley said.  After inquiring if the pair were from Memphis, the judge recommended they get legal representation. The charges were all dropped two days later, and the court refunded the $250 in costs the family had paid. The TSA did not immediately return a request for comment. But a TSA spokeswoman, Sari Koshetz, said in a statement that “passengers can call ahead of time to learn more about the screening process for their particular needs or medical situation”. “Why should I do that when we’ve been going through that airport for 17 years?” Shirley said.  “These people think they are God. They think they can do anything they want,” she said. “Well, in this country we have the Americans with Disabilities Act. And if they will do this to a disabled girl, does that mean they’ll do it to an    grandmother? It’s time for justice. ”"
2016-07-03,"On July 1, California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation requiring residents to surrender or otherwise dispose of all   gun magazines. [The   gun magazine ban goes into effect July 1, 2017, and the language of the ban  —   contained in SB 1446  —   leaves no question as to the limited options for owners of such magazines:  Brown, a   Democrat, also signed a bill creating ammunition background checks in the state, which means   citizens will have to go through a background check for ammunition in the same way they go through a check for firearm purchases. And, as the Los Angeles Times reports, Brown also signed a “ban [on] the sale of semiautomatic rifles equipped with bullet buttons” and a prohibition against loaning guns to family members  —   unless said family members also pass a background check. Regarding the ammunition background checks, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence told the New York Times that the hope is they will serve as a backdoor tool for finding guns that aren’t on the books  —   something gun control advocates have been trying to do on the national level for decades. The Brady Campaign’s Amanda Wilcox said, “It can give us a handle on who has illegal guns in the state. ” However, there is a difference between “illegal guns” and   guns, which may include legal guns (and legal gun owners) that are not in the state government’s database. It is important to point out that the   magazine ban basically limits Californians to using the same size magazines Elliot Rodger used in his 2014 mass shooting in Santa Barbara.

He also mentioned   that the event further justified the advantage of being a   transatlantic bank because despite sterling going down, Barclays’’   dollar business went suitably up.” ’ ’   ”He also mentioned how the main focus for turning profit this   year will be the sale of the   businesses, which is   completely unaffected by Brexit, so we should be in really good   stead by the end of next year.

2016-07-05,"The time will be ripe for comprehensive immigration reform next year, Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) tells Politico, and some senators are already making plans to revive their polarizing Gang of Eight bill. [According to Politico, the South Carolina Republican and others are looking to capitalize on what they expect to be a GOP defeat in November.  “I’ll tell you what I’m going to do in 2017,” Graham said to Politico. “I’m going to take the Gang of Eight bill out, dust it off and ask anybody and everybody who wants to work with me to make it better to do so. ” Graham was a member of the Gang of Eight that tried to push through comprehensive immigration reform, which included amnesty for illegal immigrants, in 2013. The legislation passed in the Senate but failed to make it through the House. As Politico reports, Graham is not the only former member of the “gang” who sees 2017 as possibly the year for comprehensive immigration reform. “The hour [when] we can move it, we’ve got to move it,” Sen. Jeff Flake ( ) another Gang of Eight member told Politico. “If they don’t [understand the urgency] we’ll do another autopsy after the next election and we’ll determine we’ve got to do it. ” Flake was referencing the Republican National Committee’s 2013 report detailing the reasons the GOP lost the 2012 election. The   autopsy recommended adopting comprehensive immigration reform as a way to expand the party’s appeal. While Flake and Graham are ready for another run at comprehensive immigration reform, the other two Republican members of the group Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and Sen. John McCain ( )  —   both of whom are facing reelection this year  —   are not necessary back in the bandwagon. “I don’t believe that a comprehensive approach can pass, nor do I believe at this point, given everything that’s transpired, that it’s the right way forward,” Rubio told Politico. McCain responded to questions about a Gang of Eight redux by telling Politico, “All I focus on is my election. Then I set the agenda for the next year. ” He added, “I’m very superstitious about that. ” Sen. Chuck Schemer ( ) who is in line to become the next leader of the Democrats in the Senate, has also pinned 2017 as the year for reform. “I think that in 2017, both Democrats and Republicans will come together and pass immigration reform,” Schumer, another Gang of Eight member, said in April. Although some lawmakers might already have their legislative game pieces on the board, Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) a staunch opponent of amnesty and the higher immigration levels included in past reform efforts, told Politico the election is not over yet. “The presidential election is just decisive on the whole situation in the sense that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama seem quite comfortable with the lawlessness that we have and seek constantly to increase immigration lawfully,” Sessions told Politico. “A Trump victory means that we will, I think in [a] rather short period of time, end the lawlessness at the border and will bring the country around to what I think a substantial majority favor. ”"
2016-07-06,"Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes has been sued for sexual harassment by a longtime Fox News host and anchor who alleges her career suffered at the network because she refused his sexual advances. Gretchen Carlson’s contract at the network expired late last month after a long stint as the   of the morning show Fox  Friends and nearly three years hosting her own show in the afternoon. The accusations are not subtle. In a lawsuit filed in a New Jersey civil court on Wednesday, lawyers for Carlson allege Ailes repeatedly dismissed her concerns that her colleagues on Fox  Friends had created a pervasively sexist atmosphere, telling her to learn to ”get along with the boys.” When Carlson met with Ailes to complain, she alleges Ailes replied, ”I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago.” The suit says Ailes explained, ”Sometimes problems are easier to solve that way.” In other conversations, Carlson contends, Ailes underscored what he could do for her career if she would look upon his invitations favorably. And she says he frequently ogled her, commenting on her figure and telling her to turn around so he could see her rear. Carlson alleges she had   interviews taken away from her. Ultimately, she says, she was reassigned from Fox  Friends to a role anchoring an afternoon show and given a pay cut for raising objections. And she contends that she was cut from Fox altogether for rebuffing Ailes’ sexual advances. Carlson sued Ailes individually Fox News is not an official party to the suit, though it can be expected to bear Ailes’ costs. Ailes has issued a statement on the lawsuit, which reads: ”Gretchen Carlson’s allegations are false. This is a retaliatory suit for the network’s decision not to renew her contract, which was due to the fact that her disappointingly low ratings were dragging down the afternoon lineup. When Fox News did not commence any negotiations to renew her contract, Ms. Carlson became aware that her career with the network was likely over and conveniently began to pursue a lawsuit. Ironically, FOX News provided her with more   opportunities over her 11 year tenure than any other employer in the industry, for which she thanked me in her recent book. This defamatory lawsuit is not only offensive, it is wholly without merit and will be defended vigorously.” A statement issued by 21st Century Fox said the company has seen the allegations. ”We take these matters seriously,” it read. ”While we have full confidence in Mr. Ailes and Mr. Doocy, who have served the company brilliantly for over two decades, we have commenced an internal review of the matter.” In perhaps the most explosive part of her lawsuit for the network, Carlson appears willing to force female Fox   personalities to testify about whether they experienced sexual harassment  —   and whether they traded sexual favors with Ailes or other executives for jobs or financial gain. In detailing what she called her demotion to the 2 p. m. slot, Carlson’s lawsuit states that Ailes reduced her pay though her workload as a solo host increased and ”refused to provide her with anywhere near the level of network media support and promotion provided to other Fox News hosts who did not complain about harassment and rebuff his sexual advances.” On the air, Fox  Friends   Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade offer the program something of a frat house ethos. In her lawsuit, Carlson alleges that Doocy routinely belittled, shunned and isolated her, even putting his hand on her during broadcasts to silence her. Kilmeade, who has referred to women as ”babes” and ”chicks” on the show, once inspired Carlson to walk off the set after one sexist comment too many. (She later said it had been a joke on her part.) Carlson is a   violinist who is both a Miss America winner and a Stanford University graduate who went on to study at Oxford University. She wrote in her memoir that because of her looks, she felt   about whether people took her seriously. According to Ailes’ unauthorized biographer, Gabriel Sherman, Ailes once pointed out Carlson to an associate as a Miss America, and then added, ”It must not have been a good year.” Carlson’s lawsuit seeks unspecified compensation for damages. In the past, Fox News has proved willing to settle cases rather let them fester a former producer sued   host Bill O’Reilly for sexual harassment after capturing his explicit sexual   on tape. The network paid what was reported to be a   settlement to keep that lawsuit from going to trial. Lachlan and James Murdoch, the brothers who run 21st Century Fox on a daily basis, have a wary relationship with Ailes. Their father, Rupert Murdoch, Ailes’ patron and still the company’s controlling owner, is all but certain to reward the years of loyalty and strong annual profits the Fox News chief has offered  —   almost regardless of what facts emerge. NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik is the author of Murdoch’s World: The Last of the Old Media Empires."
2016-07-07,"Conservative author, commentator, and columnist Ann Coulter appears on The Milo Yiannopoulos Show this week to discuss Donald Trump, the future of the #NeverTrump movement and how the mainstream media spins stories for their own gain. [A preview of the episode, which airs on Friday, can be watched below. This is Ann Coulter’s second appearance on the podcast  —   you can listen to the first one here.   “As we were talking about before, Fox news and other conservative talk radio hosts, they think they make more money when a Democrat is in office. ” said Ann, Milo replied to this claim saying, “This is something I’ve wondered about because you look at commentators who have kind of gone all in on the Never Trump thing. What I’m thinking is that there’s one option, that they’re simply principled conservatives who would rather go down with the ship so long as they don’t compromise their beliefs, and then I meet them and realise that can’t be it. The second option is, do they just think it’s good for business to have Hillary as president?” “I’d say there are two camps, one are the people that make money in Washington, Washington is like there’s something in the water now, their entire raison d’etre, their lives their livelihoods have been proved irrelevant by Trump. I talk about this in my next book, ‘In Trump We Trust’. The subtitle is ‘E Pluribus Awesome’ out August 23rd ” Ann continued. “So there’s that crowd, the Washington crowd, but the mistake they’re making is, the idea that they think there’s gonna be a functioning Republican party if they take Trump down because if Trump loses, there is one group of people that are gonna be blamed and that is the establishment Republicans, the Never Trump crowd, they will never get that Trump vote, it’s the end of the Republican party and I think it’s the end of the country anyway if Hillary gets elected. ” “As for the talk radio hosts or Fox news who think oh people love to watch when we bash the Democrats, well you have to win once in awhile. People will go and keep rooting for The Mets but if they keep losing, the stadiums are empty. It’s about to be “all we’re gonna do is lose” and that’s not a fun thing to watch”"

2016-07-09,"For the city’s 66 million annual tourists there are parts of Orlando that you can’t help but see: the Mickey   street lamps the city’s enormous ferris wheel and billboard after billboard hawking the new Harry Potter attraction at Universal Orlando. But there’s another Orlando that, like Disney World’s utilidors, you won’t see in the trip from the airport to the theme park, unless you go looking for it  —   an Orlando with more Spanish moss than palm trees, one with dozens of little lakes, and train stations to ferry people to work rather than the Magic Kingdom.  Almost 48% of companies here are   and nearly 30% of the population is Latino. In Osceola County  —   just south of Orlando, where housing is somewhat less expensive  —   48% of firms are   and 49. 7% of the population is Latino. That number is growing, in part spurred by a recent influx to Florida of Puerto Ricans fleeing the effects of the financial crisis on the island. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration regional office estimates that 1, 000 Puerto Rican families relocate to Florida every month as a result, the state is poised, for the first time, to edge New York out as the state with the most Puerto Ricans.  And though many Puerto Rican voters in Florida are focused on the financial crisis on the island, that doesn’t mean that they’re unconcerned with the rhetoric around immigration and “Mexicans” as epitomized by statements made by people like Donald Trump. Like many Latinos in the US, they know full well that most white Americans who run around insulting “Mexicans” are using it as a substitute for “Latino”. Real estate broker Orlando Rodríguez, 41, spoke in Spanish, concerned that his English wasn’t good enough and his accent too thick. “When I’m speaking to an American, if I don’t speak properly sometimes they get annoyed,” he explained. “That’s what I’ve mostly come across,” he said, in terms of overt, individualized racism. “Americans don’t see us as US citizens Americans see all Latinos as Mexicans. Just like we think all Asians are Chinese  —   they could be Korean, Japanese, Indonesian but we see them and think ‘they’re all Chinese’. Lots of Americans see [Latinos] as all the same. ” And though this issues that individual groups of Latinos might be different  —   from Cuba policy to the financial crisis on Puerto Rico, and from immigration enforcement to raising the minimum wage  —   they all eventually find themselves bound together by their daily experiences. They aren’t “all the same” yet they too often all get treated with the same basic disrespect. Jose Martinez, 35, like many Puerto Ricans, has very fair skin. “I look ‘American’ from the States,” he explained. “[But] when I start talking in English, I have an accent. ” He was at a cousin’s wedding on Cape Cod a few years ago, waiting to play pool and, “when I came to the table, I changed the rules to the Puerto Rican way and the guys were cool with it, but the bouncer, [he heard] me, threw me out. ” That was only his first time: “When I worked with Fema [after Hurricane Sandy, inspecting housing damaged by the storm] when I went down to Queens, stayed the night and [the residents] looked at me normal until I started speaking and then they knew I was Puerto Rican. ” “But I was working for the federal government, so they were respecting me because I was doing the inspections. If not, you know what happens. ” Julie Torres, 32, thinks that race plays a role in the way many white Americans view not just Puerto Ricans or just Latinos, but the whole relationship between the US government and Puerto Rico. “There is a history of racialization that I think that does impact how we view Puerto Rico as kind of this ‘other’ this other entity, this other culture, this other people, that could come into play,” the doctoral student said. “I mean, people think ‘American’ [they think] white America. ”  But unlike the 11 million undocumented immigrants Donald Trump has promised to deport in his first two years in office, Puerto Ricans are US citizens, and eligible to vote, whether they live in Puerto Rico or on the mainland.  In a swing state like Florida (where George W Bush’s official margin of victory in 2000 was just 537 votes) an influx of thousands of Puerto Rican voters  —   who lean Democratic  —   could definitely swing Florida’s 29 electoral college votes in November. About 400, 000 of people of Puerto Rican extraction now live in Orlando many of the most recent arrivals speak limited English, which prevents them from obtaining comparative jobs in the fields they left behind on “the island” but, with taxes and the cost of living going up and jobs disappearing there as a result of the ongoing financial crisis, they see few alternatives to building a new life on the mainland. Martinez is one of those recent arrivals: apologetic about his accented but   English, he explained that he moved to Orlando in  . Though he was a real estate broker on the island, his license didn’t transfer, so he’s working in construction temporarily. “I had a good job down there,” he said over traditional Puerto Rican food at Lechonera el Jibarito #2, “but when I was seeing what was going on, I decided, I’m going to jump the hoop and see what happens. ” Rodríguez and elementary school teacher Tania Irizarry, 39, moved to Orlando 10 months ago with their    son for similar reasons  —   though the financial crisis was, for them, just the final frustration with a political system rigged against most of the residents. “The ordinary people have to bear the brunt of the situation,” Rodríguez said. “They have to put up with bad health and education services and with crime. Job prospects aren’t good. Crime levels are through the roof. ” But, “it doesn’t matter [to the politicians] what state our education or health services are in,” he added. “They’ll fall over themselves trying to win the election and run the colony because there’s money in it that they’re going to earn they’ll share it out amongst themselves and they’ll be fine. Everyone else can go to hell. ” Irizarry, who was able to transfer her teacher’s license from the island and now works as an assistant teacher, says that the educational system and the lack of access to information holds back many of the people on the island. “Everything has to do with the political system and with colonialism, because you’re only taught one part: the part that’s in the interest of whoever wants to keep control of the country,” she said in Spanish, though she is fully fluent in English.  Torres, who was born in the Bronx of Puerto Rican extraction, moved to the city from Illinois as part of her doctoral research into Puerto Rican migration patterns. Like Irizarry, she sees the echoes of American colonialism in both the economic crisis and the lack of access to services  —   like education  —   that most Americans all but consider their birthright. “I think that we do need to recognize just how the deeply rooted history of colonialism on the island has impacted Puerto Rico and the economy and all these different facets,” she said. Esteban Garcés, 35, doesn’t want ignorance to be a problem for the Puerto Ricans moving to central Florida. Born in Washington, DC to a Bolivian immigrant, he is also a recent transplant to Orlando, where he works as an organizer with Mi Familia Vota, helping educate Latinos about their rights and getting them to the polls. But after stints in DC and Boston, Massachusetts, where immigration issues are paramount, he says that large Puerto Rican population in and around Orlando isn’t as focused on immigration: like Rodríguez, Irizarry and Martinez, they’re very focused on what Congress is or is not doing to end the financial crisis on the island. He says he tells the people with whom he interacts: “If we have folks from Puerto Rico voting here, they can affect what happens on the island from here to central Florida. Congress listens to voters here. ”  He added: “You can elect who goes to Congress and that person has a vote in Congress here and you can vote for the president here. And that’s not the case in Puerto Rico. ” The sheer volume of Puerto Ricans moving to central Florida could change more than just that  —   especially for the presidential candidates seeking to win in the state. “The Puerto Rican vote is really, if you ask me, going to determine who the next president is,” Garcés said.  “Why? Because the Latino vote here in central Florida is a swing vote in a swing region of central Florida. And this swing region of central Florida is going to determine how Florida votes. Florida is going to determine who the next president is. ”"

2016-07-11,"  Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who arrived in Baghdad Monday, announced the U. S. is sending 560 additional troops to Iraq as part of the   fight against the ”cancer” of ISIS. Most of the troops will be stationed at the recently recaptured Qarayyah airfield, which is about 25 miles south of Mosul and will be a key staging area for the upcoming U. S. and Iraqi effort to retake that city from the terror group. President Barack Obama approved the deployment. The new troop cap in Iraq is 4, 647, according to the Pentagon, although there are currently just over 3, 600 troops in the country. A senior U. S. military official said the number of additional troops is what had been requested by Gen. Sean MacFarland, commander of the coalition against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and the official added that there could be requests for more troops in the future. Carter said the additional troops will deploy in days or weeks and had already received their orders.  ”We need to be clear that there are Americans at risk here in Iraq, there have been, I’ve emphasized that right along,” Carter told reporters in Baghdad. ”They are doing all kinds of essential functions. Their basic strategic function is enabling but there is risk associated with that. Make no mistake about that.” MacFarland said U. S. forces ”will not be any closer to the enemy than we’ve been anywhere else.” ”But,” he added, ”we need to move to this place so we (will) be as close to the fighting as we have been in the Euphrates River Valley fights.” To make the retaken airfield fully functional, MacFarland said the U. S has to ”bring in a wide array of capabilities.”  ”That’s what these forces do,” he added. ”As always, when we bring forces to an area, we bring in a security envelope, there’s a security element that goes with it.” The 560 new U. S. troops are specifically for the fight to recapture Mosul. They will assist the Iraqi troops on the Qarayyah base with logistics, because a large number of Iraqis will be sent there. But the Americans may also accompany Iraqi forces. ”At every step in this campaign, we have generated and seized additional opportunities to hasten ISIL’s lasting defeat,” Carter said in a statement, using another name for ISIS. ”These additional U. S. forces will bring unique capabilities to the campaign and provide critical enabler support to Iraqi forces at a key moment in the fight.” Speaking to reporters in Baghdad, the defense secretary said, ”It’s necessary but not sufficient to destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria because this is where it began and is what I have called the parent tumor of the cancer . .. but, like cancer, ISIL has spread to . .. other places and it also threatens our homelands.” MacFarland said, ”We are starting to put pressure on the enemy’s terror networks, threat networks that are around the capital, and we’ll continue to ramp that up over time.” Rep. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Service Committee, said in a statement after the additional troops were announced that he was ”concerned that operational needs in Iraq and Syria are taking a back seat to troop levels the White House finds politically palatable.” ”The war against ISIS and Islamic extremists cannot be won by inches,” the Texas Republican said. ”Added to the President’s Afghanistan announcement last week, the United States will now be deploying thousands more troops than we have budgeted for in the President’s budget request. Those deployments can only be fully supported through a supplemental budget request. I look forward to reviewing the President’s request when he sends it to Congress, as I believe he now must.” Carter arrived in Baghdad Monday for a   visit to discuss the Iraqi army’s plans to retake Mosul, which has been in ISIS’ hands since June 2014.  On the flight to the Iraqi capital, Carter discussed the seizure of the Qarayyah airfield, which was accomplished by Iraqi forces, backed by U. S.  airstrikes, and announced Saturday by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider  . The recapture of Qarayyah, one of the biggest air bases in the country, is seen as a breakthrough in the mission to liberate Mosul, and comes just weeks after Iraq declared it had regained full control of Falluja, ISIS’ main stronghold, as the militant group continues to lose ground. Iraqi officials said they will move the headquarters for the liberation of Mosul to Qarayyah and its airstrip will bring Iraqi and coalition aircraft that much closer to the city. Is ISIS going broke? U. S. involvement?  Carter also reiterated on the flight to Baghdad that U. S. forces would accompany an assault    in an advisory capacity    on Mosul, Iraq’s   city and the largest in Iraq under ISIS control.  ”U. S. units are prepared to advise and accompany to the battalion level,” Carter said. ”All of that is part of the campaign plan that we’ve agreed to with Iraqis.” On his fifth trip to the Iraqi capital, Carter was greeted at his plane in Baghdad by U. S. Ambassador to Iraq Stuart Jones and MacFarland. During a meeting later at the Prime Minister’s office, Carter expressed condolences to the Iraqi people on behalf of the U. S. for the recent terror attacks in Iraq and said they strengthened his determination to fight ISIS. Will ISIS be pushed easily from Mosul after ’mother of all battles’? Iraqi forced poised to recapture city, Iraqi Defense Minister Khalid   a Mosul native, has declared that ”2016 will be the year of the liberation of Mosul and the rest of Iraq.” Already, in just over a year, Iraq has driven ISIS out of the key cities of Tikrit, Ramadi and Falluja. Iraqi and Kurdish forces have been training and preparing for the final battle.  A new ”Nineveh Liberation Operations Center” has been set up to coordinate the offensive, complete with dozens of U. S. and British advisers. Nineveh is the province where Mosul is located. A U. S. artillery unit is also providing cover for operations south of Mosul. Kurdish forces, or Peshmarga, are dug in to the east, north and west of Mosul, and Iraqi forces are moving slowly from the south. If previous experience is anything to go by, they’ll probably encircle the city, clearing ISIS from the towns and villages around it before entering the city proper.

2016-07-12,"So many things about this election are unprecedented  —   and one of the most obvious is how much voters dislike the candidates. By now, everyone knows that this year features the two most unpopular presumptive   candidates on record. But in some ways, Americans’ dislike of the presidential candidates isn’t so remarkable. In fact, a recent report from the Pew Research Center shows that 1992 voters were just as disappointed in their candidate choices, perhaps even more so, than voters are today. That helped open the door to the most successful   candidate (by popular vote) in more than 100 years, Ross Perot. This year, despite constant chatter about independent candidates and new interest in the Libertarian and Green parties, no outsider candidate has looked competitive yet (though some polls have shown Libertarian Gary Johnson polling in  ). Perot’s 1992 run is an excellent foil for showing what is making a   run particularly difficult this year. The political landscape in 1992, In June 1992, only around 40 percent of Republicans or Republican leaners were ”very” or ”fairly” satisfied with their choices: sitting Republican President George H. W. Bush, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and businessman Perot, running as an independent. So what were people so upset about? This 1992 article from the New York Times spells it out: 78 percent of Americans disapproved of Bush’s handling of the economy. Indeed, the U. S. was just out of a recession, with unemployment peaking at 7. 8 percent in June 1992. And even a quote from a 1992 Bush adviser would fit perfectly into many articles about this year’s election: ”It’s clear that no matter what the economic statistics show, voters still do not feel the economy is getting better.” Meanwhile, Clinton was dogged by accusations that he had avoided the draft in 1969, as well as reports of extramarital affairs. 1992 voters’ specific grievances with the candidates were different from those of 2016 voters, but a couple of other statistics make 1992 look a lot like 2016. Both   candidates had   favorability ratings: By one poll, Bush, at the end of June, had a net favorability of   and Clinton was at  . Americans were also pessimistic in general about the state of politics: Their trust of Washington was low and getting lower  —   29 percent of Americans in July 1992 said they trust government ”just about always” or ”most of the time.” As of 2015, that figure was at 19 percent. In the aftermath of the election, voter dissatisfaction for the other two candidates was understood to have opened the door for Perot, who would, come November, earn nearly 19 percent of the popular vote (but win no states). What did Perot have that Gary Johnson doesn’t? (Aside from charts) This year,   candidates are doing well, at least compared with the last presidential election  —   the media have certainly started paying more attention this year. Recent   matchups between Johnson, Trump and Clinton show Johnson with anywhere from 4 percent to 10 percent support.   polling matchups including the Green Party’s Jill Stein show that, combined, Johnson and Stein have the support of anywhere from 7 to 14 percent of registered voters. That’s respectable compared with 2012, when Johnson and Stein were also the respective Libertarian and Green nominees. On Election Day, Johnson came in with about 1 percent of the vote in 2012, and Stein with less than half a percent. But that’s nothing compared with 1992. At one point early that summer, Perot led Bush and Clinton, with the support of 39 percent of voters, and he eventually went on to get 19 percent of the vote. What was on Perot’s side? Dissatisfaction with Clinton and Bush helped him gain a foothold  —   particularly dissatisfaction with the economy under Bush  —   but a few other things boosted him: 1. Money: The most obvious factor: Perot was able to   dumping an estimated $68. 4 million into his campaign (more than $117 million, in today’s dollars). That helped him drive that campaign’s ad spending upward (and it gave America Perot’s memorable   ”infomercials”). 2. An open lane: Another thing that boosted Perot was that Bush and Clinton were both viewed as somewhat centrist, according to James McCann, a professor of political science at Purdue who has studied   candidates. Bush had reneged on his famous ”no new taxes” promise, upsetting conservatives. Clinton, meanwhile, was a ”new Democrat,” running as a centrist. That left Perot plenty of room. ”There’s also this argument out there in the literature that when the two major nominees sort of converge in terms of issues, they leave open a space that somebody else can fill,” McCann said. ”When that happens, that can encourage third parties and give them sort of traction.” While neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump are at the ideological extremes of their parties, they are certainly far apart on most issues. A centrist candidate may have been able to appeal to moderate voters, but one hasn’t shown up (and by now, it’s already too late to get onto the ballot in some states). And in some ways, Trump occupies the Perot space this year (appealing to white voters, railing against trade and promoting isolation) as David Bernstein wrote in Politico Magazine. Johnson and Stein, of course, have nearly four months to gain more ground, but McCann points out that an independent candidate would have more freedom to maneuver to somewhere between Clinton and Trump. ”[Johnson] is a libertarian. He can’t diverge much from his own party’s orthodoxy,” he said. ”If you were going to find a genuine   candidate who would be competitive, you’d say, ’OK, what are the issue gaps here?’ ” Plus, while people say they want an independent kind of candidate, it’s exceedingly hard to find ideological agreement among those disaffected voters. Other Pew findings go hand in hand with this idea of Trump and Clinton being so different: For example, 74 percent of voters say it ”really matters who wins” the election, the highest measure since 2000. Pew also finds that the majority of Trump supporters (55 percent) are voting against Clinton. And about equal shares of Clinton supporters are voting against Trump (50 percent) versus 48 percent voting for her, according to Pew’s data. Pew doesn’t have data on this question from this point in 1992, but as of that October, 57 percent of both Clinton and Bush’s respective voters said they were voting for their candidates. (Then again, at that point, voters were more satisfied with their candidates.) 3. Lack of polarization: American voters simply weren’t as polarized in 1992 as they are today. The fact that this year’s voters are so opposed to the other party squares with recent findings about growing political polarization. Pew has found that in the past two decades, Democrats and Republicans have grown farther and farther apart ideologically. Affective polarization  —   simply put, how much liberals and conservatives dislike each other  —   is on the rise as well. One astounding measure of this: As of 1960, only 4 percent of Democrats and 5 percent of Republicans said they would be ”displeased” if their son or daughter married someone of the opposite party, according to a 2012 study from Stanford University. In 2010, the shares who would be ”somewhat or very unhappy” were 33 percent for Democrats and 49 percent for Republicans. That polarization may be one more force that will hold back   candidates: People may be particularly afraid of supporting a potential spoiler. It may mean voting for someone they’re not crazy about, but a voter who really hates the other party would be more likely to do that, if it means stopping the other team from winning."
2016-07-13,"DeRay Mckesson, one of the best known voices for the Black Lives Matter movement, was among hundreds of people arrested at weekend demonstrations across the country. He spent 16 hours in a Baton Rouge jail cell until he was released Sunday afternoon, vowing to continue demonstrating because he was convinced that the authorities want activists to be “too afraid to protest. ” Mr. Mckesson, in a telephone interview shortly after his release, said he believed that his arrest was unlawful and that the police unfairly conducted mass arrests while people were peacefully assembled and out of the way of traffic along a highway. In a booking record, Baton Rouge authorities said Mr. Mckesson ignored a police officer’s order to stay out of the road and as a result was charged with simple obstruction of a highway of commerce. He was released on his own recognizance. On Sunday night, he was at the Triple S convenience store, where Mr Sterling was shot a week ago, and which on this night was distinctly devoid of police officers after tense protests downtown hours earlier. “The police want protesters to be too afraid to protest, which is why they intentionally created a context of conflict, and I’ll never be afraid to tell the truth,” he said. “What we saw in Baton Rouge was a police department that chose to provoke protesters to create, like, a context of conflict they could exploit. ” He said that officers chased several protesters and that he had retained a lawyer. He added that he and others jailed remain committed to the Black Lives Matter movement and would continue to use civil disobedience to make their points. Mr. Mckesson and several others traveled to Baton Rouge to protest the death of Alton Sterling, who was fatally shot early Tuesday. The authorities arrested more than 100 people in connection with a protest outside the city’s police headquarters, charging most of them with obstructing the road. Eight firearms were confiscated and one officer lost several teeth after he was struck by a projectile, the police said. At a news conference in Baton Rouge, law enforcement officials defended arresting people who had stepped onto a highway against police commands, saying that streets had been closed for marches elsewhere but that this was a major thoroughfare and needed to remain open. “We certainly respect the right people have to gather peacefully, to protest peacefully and we’re going to protect that right,” said Sheriff Sid J. Gautreaux III of East Baton Rouge Parish. “At the same time we’re not going to tolerate any violence, we’re not going to tolerate any lawlessness, we’re not going to tolerate any destruction of property. ” Mr. Mckesson filmed his encounter with the police using the   app Periscope. On camera, he told viewers that there was no sidewalk where they were walking. An officer could be heard shouting, “You with them loud shoes, I see you in the road. If I get close to you, you’re going to jail. ” “I think he’s talking to me, y’all,” said Mr. Mckesson, who often wears red sneakers to demonstrations. Later, Mr. Mckesson said, “Watch the police, they are just literally provoking people. ” Then, about five minutes into the broadcast, the video becomes shaky and a police officer can be heard saying: “City police. You’re under arrest. Don’t fight me. Don’t fight me. ” Sunday night, Mr. Mckesson said once he was taken into custody he was put in a van with dozens of others and was able to use another person’s phone to text people about what happened. He was eventually taken to East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. There he was at times housed with some 50 other men who took turns sitting on packed benches and sleeping on the floor. “Not everybody could fit,” he said. “Some of us had to stand. I, like many other people, slept on the floor or didn’t sleep at all because there just wasn’t enough room. ” After hours, Mr. Mckesson and others were then told to change into   jumpsuits and were fed a breakfast of orange juice, oatmeal and pastries. While inside, Mr. Mckesson was able to make several calls to his lawyers and friends to strategize how to be released. Mr. Mckesson, 31, a public school administrator turned activist, first gained national notice with his blunt critiques on Twitter of the police response in Ferguson, Mo. after the death of Michael Brown in 2014. He ran for mayor of Baltimore, his hometown, this year, ultimately losing the Democratic primary in April to Catherine E. Pugh."
2016-07-14,"      When Haley Lind was found alone in a stranger’s bathroom, she was naked and in a drunken stupor, barely able to stand or speak, a raucous party raging around her. She awoke in her bed hours later, her head pounding, leaves in her hair, soaked in her own urine.  “I think I got assaulted last night,” she texted a friend the morning after the annual     Block Party at the University of Virginia. “Something just feels very wrong. ” In a dorm room about a mile away, a freshman athlete got up that same morning with a clear memory of his first college party, just days into his  . career. At an   residence where athletes lived, there had been the cups of a potent liquor drink and crowds of sloshed students. An alluring, petite blonde had led him into an upstairs bathroom for sex, a rash decision that would end up haunting him. An epic first weekend at college, he said in an interview, turned into “living with a kind of shadow following you around in whatever you do. ” For both students, the night of Aug. 22, 2015, had not gone as planned. And their brief     interaction  —   not unlike so many others on the nation’s college campuses  —   would derail both of their lives for much of an academic year and probably beyond. To him, in that moment, it was a thrilling hookup at a party. To her  —   as she now sees it  —   it was a terrifying assault. To  . it was another drunken mess with no good answers.  [College sexual assault: 1 in 5 college women say they were violated]  The case is emblematic of the widespread frustrations faced by students, parents and administrators as they confront a problem that has existed for decades: the caustic combination of alcohol, drugs and sex, at times exacerbated by assault and predation. It also highlights the problems the Charlottesville flagship has had with alcohol and partying. Recent misconduct investigations on the nation’s campuses, some involving NCAA athletes, have reinvigorated a widespread discussion about college sexual assault. Allegations involving the football program at Baylor University forced the resignation of its president and the ouster of its football coach. At Yale University, the captain of the basketball team sat out the school’s historic run to the NCAA tournament because he was fighting his expulsion for an alleged sex offense.  [Expelled basketball captain sues Yale, saying alleged ‘sexual misconduct’ was consensual]  And at Stanford University in June, a freshman swimmer’s   sentence after he was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman outside a fraternity party elicited heated debate about the ramifications of such attacks.  [‘We’re horrified’: At Stanford, the impact of a sexual assault is searing]  The Washington Post reconstructed the events of the night Lind says she was sexually assaulted at  .  —   and the turmoil that followed  —   through a review of internal school records, witness statements and legal documents, as well as in numerous interviews, including with Lind, the freshman athlete she accused and their attorneys. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity about the events at Block Party because  . officials instructed athletes, in a mass email, not to speak with reporters. According to internal  . records, one coach instructed his athletes not to discuss what happened that night: “I told the team let’s just keep this in house,” the coach told  . according to a transcript of a conversation with investigators obtained by The Post. “We’re just praying that that stays lidded up. ”  . President Teresa A. Sullivan declined to comment on the specifics of the case. The Post generally does not identify people who say they were sexually assaulted, but Lind agreed to speak on the record about her ordeal and the trauma she said she endured as she sought justice. She told The Post that by identifying herself she is lending accountability to her experience on a campus that was labeled as having a “hostile environment” for survivors of trauma and sexual violence by the U. S. Education Department last year. “I’m tired of hiding behind it,” Lind said. “It needs to be heard and I want my version of events to be told truthfully. ” The Post also generally does not identify people accused of sexual assault unless they have been charged with a crime or have been found responsible in a disciplinary hearing. The freshman athlete spent his entire first year under the scrutiny of a rigorous internal  . probe that wrapped up in May and found that he was not responsible for any violation of school policy. The  . administration also notified the Charlottesville Police Department, which opened an investigation that has since been suspended; the freshman athlete has not been charged with a crime, and because the investigation has been suspended it is unlikely that he will be. He agreed to speak to The Post on the condition of anonymity.     University of Virginia sophomore volleyball player Haley Lind at practice in 2013, when she was at West Ranch High School in Stevenson Ranch, Calif. (Dan Watson   Santa Clarita Valley Signal )  Their ordeal provides a sobering portrait of the   consequences of college party culture. It exposes the challenges students face in deciphering consent while drunk and in piecing together fragmented memories. It also shows how schools are placed in an almost untenable position of trying to determine what happened and who is at fault  —   if anyone.  [Drinking is central to college culture  —   and to sexual assault]   . investigators Maureen Holland and Suzan Garson conducted 25 interviews and wrote a final report spanning 96 pages. One aspect of the case quickly became clear: The two students knew each other for half an hour before ending the night naked together in an upstairs bathroom.  Block Party Block Party is an annual drinking tradition, with swarms of students converging on Wertland Street to kick off the school year. It is a massive fete that flows from house to house, and it is a particular draw for the school’s   athletes and for freshmen new to campus. Lind, 19, a scholarship sophomore volleyball player from Southern California, started the evening in her apartment, eating a peanut butter and banana sandwich for dinner and nursing a Smirnoff Ice. She then downed two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka with her teammates. She had planned to drink that night but had spoken with a teammate about making sure they did not  . The two students even wrote out an    drinking schedule that the athletes dubbed their “shot clock. ” Lind headed out to begin Block Party at a small house on Wertland sometime after 10 p. m. The freshman athlete, too, joined friends for beer pong at the same house. There, members of the wrestling, soccer, swim, football and volleyball teams  —   among others  —   circulated, mingled, drank. “There were, like, police vans like trying to break up the crowds,” a female athlete told  . officials later. “It looked like a riot. ”    Crowds pack the streets around the University of Virginia at the 2013 Block Party, which is not condoned by the university. (theblacksheeponline. com)  A  . spokesman said that Block Party is not condoned by the university, and in a statement provided to The Post, Sullivan acknowledged that “alcohol abuse, including underage drinking, is a challenge facing colleges and universities across the nation. ”  [From the archives:  . ’s entrenched fraternity culture at tipping point]  The residents of the house had prepared for a chaotic night, purchasing five kegs of beer and a dozen   “handles” of liquor for the house’s signature cocktail. They also had a   backpack sprayer that the investigators noted in their report was designed for spreading agricultural chemicals. “It was like a mobile bartender,” one of the hosts told investigators. One older student spent part of the evening patrolling the house. “I wanted to make sure no one was like punching walls or you know, stealing stuff,” he told the  . investigators. “I just made sure no one was puking anywhere, that no one was passed out in the front yard or anything like that. ” Amid the chaos, Lind and the freshman found each other about 11 p. m. As the freshman athlete introduced himself, another athlete walked over with the pesticide sprayer. Both of the students opened their mouths for a squirt. Lind said the mixture flowed rapidly, ultimately dousing her white tank top. She remembers nothing more from that night, she told The Post. “There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t think about that night,” Lind said. “Imagining what could have happened, and that I will never know what happened that night, is the worst part of all. ” Lind, her friends and  . investigators were left to piece together the rest in retrospect. Investigators found Lind’s description of her memory loss “credible” but also wrote that they were left to rely on the freshman athlete’s account of certain aspects of the night because he and Lind were, at times, alone.  Both were drunk The freshman athlete said that he drank five beers and one and a half cups of the liquor drink. Lind said she had a few drinks, and witnesses differed on how she appeared at the party; one said she was “belligerent, like really, really drunk,” and another said that she was tipsy but that “it wasn’t like she was falling over or anything. ” After drinking the liquor concoction from the sprayer, Lind’s teammate left early, vomited the rest of the night and also had trouble remembering the party they had attended. Lind remained with the freshman athlete. He told The Post that he and Lind were flirting, and he believed she was attracted to him  —   witnesses said they saw the two kissing, holding hands and caressing. He said Lind asked him back to her apartment, an invitation another student overheard. Instead, the freshman athlete suggested finding a room inside the house. She smiled, he told investigators, and agreed. They headed upstairs. On the second floor, the athlete said, Lind walked into a bathroom and led him inside by the hand. They discussed using a condom, he said, and he took one out of his wallet. She unwrapped the condom and placed it on him, he said. At one point, according to the report, the freshman athlete attempted to stop because he believed he heard someone try to enter the bathroom. He told investigators that Lind put her arm around his waist and said “keep going. ” According to the  . report, an older resident of the house became aware that Lind and the freshman athlete were inside the bathroom and angrily climbed out onto a second story roof to slam on the window and get their attention. He yelled at them to break it up. “Would you just give us a minute?” Lind said, the older resident told investigators.    A Washington   poll released in June 2015 found that 1 in 5 women say they were sexually assaulted while in college. One of the poll’s findings was that students differ on what constitutes consent. We asked some other local college students to define the word. (Jayne W. Orenstein and Jorge   Washington Post)   Startled, the freshman grabbed his clothes and bolted for the door, leaving Lind behind. A few minutes later, a wrestler found Lind in the bathroom, naked but for her shoes. He said she stumbled drunkenly into the bathtub, apparently hitting her head, and said she was “too drunk to, like, realize what was going on. ” “Because [Lind] has no memory she is unable to offer any facts that support or refute others’ descriptions of the events,” Holland and Garson wrote. “We note that [the freshman athlete] is the only person who described what occurred in the bathroom. ” The wrestler helped Lind get dressed. Once outside, Lind and the wrestler began walking arm in arm when they were spotted at 11:45 p. m. by a Charlottesville police officer, who noticed that Lind was “very intoxicated,” was unable to walk without assistance, and had slurred speech and a vacant look in her eyes. Lind says she had no recollection of interacting with a police officer; she was allowed to continue home to her apartment. When she woke up in the morning, Lind sensed something amiss. “I felt like I had been violated in some way, but I didn’t know what it was,” she said, noting that when she realized she had wet the bed she became more concerned. “That scared me because I was so unconscious I could not wake myself up to get to the bathroom. ” Lind cautiously began trying to   her night. She reached out to the wrestler who had found her in the bathroom, and he told her that she was “very out of it” when he found her. Overcome with worry, Lind confided in a friend, a  . football player, telling him in a text message that she believed she had been assaulted but had no idea who the person was. “R U ok?” He replied. “No I have no memory,” she wrote. “No I’m physically okay but I don’t feel mentally okay. Something just feels very wrong. ” She wrote that she was concerned someone at the party might have drugged her. The investigators wrote that they determined there was no evidence that the liquor drink was tainted with drugs and that there was no evidence the freshman athlete had provided Lind with any alcohol.  A surprise meeting Desperate for answers, Lind spoke to other athletes who attended Block Party, and they arranged a meeting between her and the freshman athlete so she could confront him. The meeting caught the freshman athlete by surprise. He was taken to an   apartment shared by two older athletes on his team. Aware that the conversation would involve a sensitive topic with potentially serious consequences, two students recorded the conversation in an effort to showcase their own innocence and to protect themselves from any possible allegations of misconduct. The recording was made without the knowledge of Lind or the freshman athlete; Virginia is a “  consent” state, which allows people to record conversations they are in without letting others know they are doing so. The   recording, which was part of the  . investigation and was obtained by The Post, captured the freshman athlete’s recounting of the events from 48 hours before. Lind said the meeting was perhaps the most embarrassing and awkward moment of her life; she listened to details of a sexual encounter she didn’t know had happened. “All I wanted was answers, and I thought no matter how hard it is, I still want to know what happened to me,” she said. The freshman athlete said that he also felt uneasy talking about what had happened: “It’s not a topic you’re comfortable talking about with people I didn’t know very well. ” The meeting quickly turned to the issue of consent. “We need to hear what, what you said to her, what she said to you from your perspective, what you can remember, all that stuff,” said an upperclassman, whom The Post is not identifying to protect the freshman athlete’s identity. The freshman athlete replied that “nothing in my mind, at any point, do I remember her telling me to stop something. ” “So you were under the impression through this that she was on board?” an older student asked. “Yes,” the freshman replied, before emotion entered his voice. “When I woke up in the morning I was just not okay. If it hurt you, I’m sorry. ” Lind said she was so drunk that there’s no way she could have consented to sex: “I just think I was so incoherently drunk that like, there was, like, no way that this was okay. ”    A teammate who accompanied Lind to the meeting then asked the freshman if there was any sign that Lind was incoherent. The freshman athlete responded: “I mean, I was so drunk myself. ”  [College students remain deeply divided over what consent actually means]  The older athletes then demanded that the freshman apologize. “You need to make damn sure that she knows this is never going to happen again, that you, like, repent for what you did,” one older student said. The freshman athlete then said that right before the surprise meeting he had attended a mandatory orientation session for all members of the Class of 2019 hosted by Allen Groves, the university’s dean of students, concerning sexual assault on campus. It had been “probably like one of the hardest things to listen to,” the freshman athlete said. “But I want you to know how sorry I am for what I did. ” “Thank you,” Lind said. “I really appreciate it. ” When the meeting ended, Lind stood up to leave. The audio recording captures the sound of the door shutting before the older students start speaking again. “You know what? You are one lucky      holy     boy,” one upperclassman said. Another older student said: “I’d buy a       lottery card if I were you. ” The freshman athlete told The Post that the meeting overwhelmed him and that he “broke down and started crying” as soon as it ended. He said he decided to apologize partly out of pressure from the older athletes and because he believed it would help Lind find peace. “I think that they wanted this to be resolved just as much as I did and that my apology would help her move through this,” he said. “I felt bad she was upset, but I never thought I did anything wrong to her. ” Although Lind had attended the meeting to seek closure, she left unsettled. The emotional pain lingered. Her performance on the volleyball court suffered. She found it hard to concentrate on coursework. She lost her appetite and became withdrawn. Lind said she struggled to come to terms with what happened and the shame that she believed she’d face as she considered taking her allegations to the administration, partly fearing that she’d be seen as a traitor for implicating another student athlete.    “I would have rather just forgotten about it and moved on,” Lind said. “But it doesn’t work that way. It was more of a psychological thing that affected me over time. ” The decision was taken out of her control in   when two seniors on the volleyball team told a female assistant coach about the incident. Obligated by strict policies, the coach used an online system called “Just Report It” on Sept. 14 to notify the  . administration about the alleged assault. Later that same day, Lind met with Associate Dean Nicole Eramo, the same  . administrator who had worked with the woman who told Rolling Stone magazine that she had been gang raped in an account that was later disproven. “She is concerned about reporting this more broadly because it will be hard on her,” Eramo wrote in her notes, according to the  . report. “She is also concerned about causing problems between the teams and athletes. ” On Sept. 15, the university told the Charlottesville police and the prosecutor’s office about the sexual assault allegations. On Sept. 25, the administration sent letters to Lind and the freshman athlete to inform them that the university had opened an official inquiry, which would last months. For the freshman athlete, the wait for a decision became a time to reflect. One night, he watched a   ESPN documentary on the 2006 Duke lacrosse scandal, “Fantastic Lies. ” The freshman athlete was mesmerized and found himself drawing comparisons to the Duke players who were alleged to have participated in the gang rape of a stripper. Eventually, the Duke lacrosse team members were exonerated. “I thought, ‘If they can make it through that then I can make it through,’ ” he said.  Nobody wins There is one thing about which both Lind and the freshman agree: Nobody wins. “Since this event, I do not feel safe on Grounds and I do not feel safe for any of my friends,” Lind said, referring to the  . campus. “I do not think anyone truly understands the situation that I was in that night or the   effects this has had on my life. ” During a hearing in the case, Lind said: “I am not the same and probably never will be the same happy positive person I used to be. It has consumed my life. ” The freshman athlete told The Post that the investigation left him drained. “I was shocked, taken aback and really scared out of my mind to be accused of something so serious and that I knew wasn’t true,” he said. The freshman athlete, meanwhile, saw his first year on campus derailed days after he arrived, and he quickly felt like an outcast. “There were times I’d put my ball cap over my eyes and hope not to be noticed,” he said. “I grew wary of other people, and I kind of lost some trust in the system. ” A decision in the case came on April 13, when Holland and Garson issued their report. They wrote that even though Lind was drunk and had blacked out, she still might have been capable of providing consent. According to  . ’s sexual assault policy, “incapacitation means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, rational judgments about whether or not to engage in sexual activity. A person who is incapacitated is unable, temporarily or permanently, to give Affirmative Consent because they are mentally or physically helpless, asleep, unconscious, or unaware that sexual activity is taking place. ” The policy also defines signs of incapacitation as “slurred or incomprehensible speech, unsteady gait, combativeness, emotional volatility, vomiting, or incontinence. ” Ultimately, the investigators concluded that the freshman athlete had no way to know that Lind had blacked out. Because he had just met her, and because she was capable of carrying on a conversation, walking upstairs and performing “fine motor tasks, such as unwrapping a condom,” he was unaware of her “possible incapacitation. ” In short, how was he supposed to know how drunk she was? The investigators determined that there was insufficient evidence to determine that the freshman was responsible for sexually assaulting Lind. Mark Schamel, an attorney for the freshman athlete, commended  . for what he said was “the most thorough and complete university investigation I have ever seen. ” “The investigation revealed what we knew from the beginning: My client was completely innocent and did nothing wrong,” Schamel said. “I have a great deal of respect for how my client faced these false allegations with such maturity and his cooperation with the investigation that exonerated him.  . and Charlottesville law enforcement determined that my client did absolutely nothing wrong and had affirmative consent; the evidence proved that. ” Lind’s attorney, James Marsh, said he also believes  . did a thorough job investigating the case, but he thought it would not be difficult to prove that Lind had been assaulted. The outcome shocked Marsh, who has handled dozens of cases during the past several years, including at  . A final appeal in Lind’s case failed on May 23 before a   panel. “Someone had to work very, very hard to reach a finding of no responsibility,” Marsh said. “Clearly, someone somewhere sees this case very differently from everyone else we’ve talked to. I’m at a loss to explain how  . reached this decision. It just doesn’t make sense. ” The   investigation demoralized Lind, who has concerns about a process that found that someone as intoxicated as she was could give consent for sex to a total stranger. Prior to the university’s findings, Lind said she believed the freshman athlete should be held to account for what happened “I’m not doubting myself for a second,” Lind said in December, months before  . cleared the athlete. “He shouldn’t go on to live a normal life like he does now. He should have a consequence for it. ” Charlottesville Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Libby Killeen declined to comment on the possibility of charges against the freshman athlete. Charlottesville police Capt. Gary Pleasants said last week that the investigation into the matter has been “suspended,” effectively meaning that it is no longer active. Warner “Dave” Chapman, the top prosecutor in Charlottesville, said that his office typically chooses to prosecute only “a handful” of sexual assault cases referred from  . each year, largely because of a lack of evidence and because cases involving students frequently involve alcohol, which can complicate witness testimony. “An incident affected by alcohol or other substances of abuse means the clarity of the evidence can be affected, and that can translate into, at times, a decision that a matter can’t be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” Chapman said. “That’s just the reality. If you can’t prove certain things, then you can’t bring a charge. ”      $(function() );   Julie Tate contributed to this report. "
2016-07-15,"A military coup has been attempted in Turkey, pitching one of the Middle East’s key hubs of power into sudden turmoil and prompting supporters of the country’s elected president to take to the streets. In a statement released through Turkish television channels on Friday night, people claiming to speak for the military said the army was in charge of the country, accusing the government of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of eroding Turkey’s secular traditions. But as soldiers and tanks moved into key positions around Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, people poured into the streets. A night of confrontations, loud blasts and gunfire ensued across the capital, with at least 17 reportedly killed and scores wounded while fighter jets and helicopters buzzed overhead. Early on Saturday morning Erdoğan’s plane landed in Istanbul, with the president clearly determined to assert that the coup had been repelled and he remained in charge. In a live TV address after his arrival at Istanbul Ataturk airport, where he was welcomed by crowds, Erdoğan said the uprising was an act of “treason” and that those responsible would pay a “heavy price”. “Those who stain the military’s reputation must leave. The process has started today and it will continue just as we fight other terrorist groups,” said a translation of his remarks. The Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said in the early hours of Saturday morning that those involved in the coup were being rounded up and more than 120 arrests had been made. On Friday night gunfire erupted outside military headquarters and vehicles blocked two major bridges in Istanbul. Soldiers and tanks at one point blocked entry to Istanbul’s main Ataturk airport and stopped flights, according to the private Dogan news agency. But the military did not appear unified, with top commanders taking to television to condemn the action and order troops back to their barracks. “Those who are attempting a coup will not succeed. Our people should know that we will overcome this,” General Zekai Aksakalli, the commander of the military special forces, told the private NTV television by telephone. Fighter jets under the control of loyalist forces flew over the capital to strike at helicopters flown by coup supporters, the   Anadolu news agency said. Private NTV television reported that one helicopter was shot down. Erdoğan said the uprising had been carried out by a “minority” within the military opposed to national unity. He claimed some in the military had been taking orders from the   cleric Fethullah Gulen, and that the attempted coup showed the Gulen was heading an armed terrorist organisation. Gulen has denied involvement. Erdogan has long accused Gulen of attempting to use his followers in the judiciary and military to undermine Turkey’s government. According to the translation, the president said he would not hand Turkey over to occupiers and that the cabinet was functioning in Ankara. Erdoğan further said he would stay “with my people”. Earlier, military vehicles had shut off parts of major cities and imposed a de facto curfew, with gunfire heard in the capital, Ankara, and in Istanbul, Turkey’s second city. Early on Saturday morning there were reports of explosions and tankfire at the Turkish parliament in Ankara but the exact situation was unclear. Fighter jets and helicopters flew overhead. The president declared that orders had been given to “eradicate” those who were shooting from the air. Barack Obama urged all parties in Turkey to back the “democratically elected” government, a clear denunciation of the attempted coup. Erdoğan had been on holiday in the resort of Marmaris when soldiers made their bid for power. The president appeared initially unable to reach television studios as reports of the coup first spread and the military appeared on the streets. He finally speaking with CNN via FaceTime two hours into the drama. Erdoğan, whose party won 49. 5% of the vote last November, called on Turks to rally in public. “I urge the Turkish people to convene at public squares and airports,” he said. “There is no power higher than the power of the people,” he continued, adding that the judiciary “will swiftly respond to this attack”. The events have the potential to change the dynamic of regional politics, with Turkey’s current government a key player  —   and previously a rare beacon of relative stability  —   in the troubled Middle East. Turkey is a Nato member and hosts US military bases. It is a major backer of rebel factions in the Syrian civil war and a key partner in Europe’s attempt to stop migration flows. The British foreign office advised UK citizens in Turkey to avoid public places. Other countries gave similar advice to their nationals. In statements to broadcasters, the coup’s leaders said that all foreign relations would remain stable under their control. But a spokesman for the president said he remained in power. “Turkey’s democratically elected president and government are in power,” the spokesman said. “We will not tolerate attempts to undermine our democracy. ” He added: “A group within the armed forces has made an attempt to overthrow the democratically elected government outside the chain of command. The statement made on behalf of the armed forces wasn’t authorised by the military command. We urge the world to stand in solidarity with the Turkish people. ” As the sun set across Turkey on Friday there had been few signs anything unusual was about to unfold. But then came television reports that roads in Istanbul had been shut, leading to fears of another terrorist threat  —   days after dozens were killed by extremists at the city’s main airport. As the night wore on rumours of a coup instead began to spread and military planes flew low overhead. Gunshots were reported in both the capital, Ankara, and in Istanbul’s Taksim Square, where secular campaigners based a shortlived protest movement against Erdogan in 2013. On Istiklal, another of the city’s main streets, people were running in all directions. Some civilians seemed to be celebrating but others were criticising the army. They included one man with a megaphone. A soldier fired his gun into the air in order to disperse the crowd. Army vehicles fanned out through Istanbul with tanks seen outside the country’s main airport and military trucks filmed blocking the bridges connecting the city’s Asian and European sides. A soldier was filmed telling  : “It’s a coup, go home. ” A de facto curfew appeared to have been imposed by parts of the military, with one state channel reporting martial law had been imposed. Angry crowds in some areas then disregarded the apparent order, gathering to protest against the coup attempt. Some squared off against soldiers, with some army officials then reportedly opening fire in return. One video appeared to show soldiers and policemen squaring up against each other. Reuters reported that tanks had opened fire near the parliament in Ankara. Some Turks rushed to stockpile food and water, and withdraw cash from banks, amid fears of a potential administrative meltdown in the coming days. Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, echoed his president’s words, telling a television interviewer: “Some people illegally undertook an illegal action outside of the chain of command. The government elected by the people remains in charge. This government will only go when the people say so. ” The presidency claimed it had the support of opposition leaders and the army high command. Turkey has a long history of coups but Erdoğan’s   government was believed to be in a stronger position than previous civilian administrations, with the president’s position shored up during a decade of economic success. He also inserted loyalists into key parts of the state apparatus and increasingly cracked down on suspected plotters. But recent events have destabilised the country, with Kurdish rebels fighting a new insurgency in the   of the country. The Syrian civil war has also spilt over into Turkey, with Isis mounting a series of terror attacks across Turkey in the past year, killing hundreds. Erdoğan’s   government was also perceived by liberal wings of Turkish society to be infringing on the secular traditions established by the father of the modern Turkish state, Kemal Ataturk.    "
2016-07-16,"Organizers of the   Afropunk Festival dropped singer M. I. A. as its headlining act due to the backlash the   rapper received after she criticized the Black Lives Matter movement in April. [“After discussing the situation with the artist and the community, a decision was agreed upon by all involved that M. I. A will no longer headline Afropunk London,” the festival’s organizers said in a statement Friday.  M. I. A. ’s ban from the musical festival stemmed from comments she made during an April interview with the Evening Standard.  “It’s interesting that in America the problem you’re allowed to talk about is Black Lives Matter,” M. I. A. said in April. “It’s not a new thing to me  —   it’s what Lauryn Hill was saying in the 1990s, or Public Enemy in the 1980s. Is Beyoncé or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters? That’s a more interesting question. ” Despite defending her controversial comments, the    rapper tweeted that she wouldn’t perform at this year’s festival. “Sorry I’m not doing Afropunk,” she tweeted last month. “I’ve been told to stay in my lane. ” While not mentioning M. I. A. by name, the Afropunk organizers explained that their decision to drop M. I. A. was about accepting people of all races and religions. “Afropunk has always stood side by side with the thousands of people globally who are involved with our events each year, from the fans attending an Afropunk showcase for the first time, to the headline artists playing for capacity crowds on our main festival stages,” organizers wrote in their statement. The statement continued: A key part of the Afropunk ethos has always been educating one another, breaking down boundaries and sparking conversation about race, gender, religion, sex, culture and everything that makes life worth living. This exchange has meant receiving wisdom, as well as imparting it in the most respectful way possible, with the participation of our entire community of fans, creators and artists. This community is something we are incredibly proud of, and this community will always be a priority for us. Interestingly enough, M. I. A. has been supportive of Black Lives Matter in the past. She praised the   movement in June in her song “Poc That Still a Ryda. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson."
2016-07-17,"   Readers recommend their favorites. Submit your own —  especially if the cover goes across genres —  via hello@theatlantic. com, and please include a short description of why you love it so much. Sarah G. is a big fan of the cover series: I’ve been following it intermittently for a while now, especially when I need a break from political coverage. It first caught my eye when you featured Richard Thompson, [who also sang] “1952 Vincent Black Lightning. ” I had just shared that video, again, on Facebook, and friends were certain that I had suggested it. But I digress. Covers of songs —  sometimes they are great, sometimes they are terrible. Pearl Jam has covered so many songs that I could spend all day just talking about and listening to their covers. Scrolling through the archive, I thought first of Jeff Buckley, which of course led me to think about I’m Your Fan, a compilation of Leonard Cohen covers by various artists. [CB: There’s another compilation of Cohen covers, I’m Your Man, which I bought after seeing the 2005 documentary of the same name, and two of its best covers are Rufus Wainwright’s “Chelsea Hotel #2” and Antony Hegarty’s “If It Be Your Will. ”] But I think I’ll take this opportunity to show some love to The Church’s album of covers from 1999, A Box of Birds. They cover the Monkees, the Beatles, Ultravox, and Neil Young, among others. I enjoyed the eclectic song selection and the hints at the band’s sense of humor and fun. Some of the tracks are faithful to the originals, others are uniquely The Church. Here’s their cover of Neil Young’s “Cortez the Killer” in all of its trippy glory. (Submit a cover via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) This reader, Richard, lets the cynicism melt away: I am the type of person that doesn’t think TV soap operas are cool. I certainly disapprove of “kiddy country” acts. I also like to think that I don’t go for   artfully designed to     music or video. But I love this video of two young girls singing a Lumineers song on an extremely soapy network TV show, Nashville. So sue me. (Submit a cover via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) Amy Jones, the reader who sent the creepy cover of Blondie’s “One Way or Another,” serves up another great one: After his 2013 album For Now I Am Winter, Bafta   artist Ólafur Arnalds collaborated with vocalist Arnor Dan, with whom he also performed on the Broadchurch soundtrack. Most of Arnalds’ music is classified as “” and though Destiny’s Child may seem a strange choice for such an artist, his cover of “Say My Name” emphasizes the desperation in the lyrics with slow, lush strings and somber acoustic piano. (Submit a cover via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) A reader in London, David Durant, takes out the cowbell but adds a lot more: Without doubt, my favourite totally transformed cover song is Apollo 440’s version of the classic Blue Oyster Cult 1976 hit “Don’t Fear the Reaper. ” (The Bangles cover of Simon and Garfunkel’s “Hazy Shade of Winter” is also awesome, but Apollo 440 takes the crown here.) I love the way the timeless smoothness of Blue Oyster Cult’s lyrics remains in place but is enhanced by the high energy of a rhythm section. This is what I want played at my funeral. (Submit your own via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) A reader in Mississippi, Amy Jones, recommends a cover that really brings out the creepiness of the lyrics: An episode of the American drama series Stalker highlighted the cover of Blondie’s hit in its fifth episode, though I first stumbled upon it via Spotify. I try not to look at my phone while driving, but I had to glance down to check if this was a cover of that old song I had never thought much about but dismissed as silly. The band, Until the Ribbon Breaks, describes their style as one that “blends genres like electronic, pop, rock, and     …     with a sharp alternative edge. ” Their cover of “One Way or Another” certainly fits that description, with soft beats underlying harmonies with just enough dissonance to be beautiful but interesting. My favorite covers are those that recast the lyrics in such a different light that the listener considers them in a new way, and this British band succeeds as their vocalist croons the old playful words with haunting conviction. Debbie Harry was inspired to write the original song after her experience with a stalker. She told Entertainment Weekly: I was actually stalked by a nutjob, so it came out of a    personal event. I tried to inject a little levity into it to make it more lighthearted. It was a survival mechanism. (Submit a cover via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) A reader in Pittsburgh, Josh, has a moving tribute to his friend: I’ve been following your cover series and would like to contribute a favorite. In March, I lost my best friend Chris —  far, far too young at only 36. In suburban Pittsburgh in the ‘90s, we were an unlikely pair. He was black, I was white, and about as physically and socially different as could be. In 10th grade, Chris joined the marching band, and playing together in the trumpet section, we became inseparable. In band, you played a wide variety of genres and were exposed to many influences. Chris and I cultivated eclectic musical tastes, and in the     days, when people defined identity by the contents of their CD binder, we could exchange any band or genre without shame. He blew my mind with a Prince record I floored him with the White Album. It united us, and as we passed through the momentary catastrophes and tender triumphs of adolescence, we always had a soundtrack. So my selection for this cover series is “Let It Be” by Gladys Knight and the Pips: McCartney’s sparse hymn is transformed by Gladys’ soaring gospel performance and the call and response into an urgent demand. It almost seems as if the Pips’ plaintive echoes are restraining her from ascending to another plane of existence. The Beatles began by playing Motown songs, and after their explosion, Motown artists covered them frequently. This cover of “Let It Be” has been solace in my personal grief, but also as an echo of the troubled times in which it was written and recorded, and a tonic to the current unrest in our civic society. I know Chris loved this song, and I know he would agree. (Submit a cover via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) From reader Conor Murphy: I nominate Aretha Franklin’s cover of “The Weight” by The Band. Taking a song as moody and solemn as that and singing it the way she does transforms it in startling ways. Switching to a soul arrangement and foregoing the piano for horns creates an entirely new dynamic within the song, while the pure power and depth of her voice is almost overwhelming.   By the way, if you want to continue the Beatles covers, you could also use Franklin’s “Eleanor Rigby,” which is similarly incredible. (Submit a cover via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) Reader John Maschoff ends a despairing week of national news on an optimistic note: This version of “We Can Work It Out” so wonderfully injects the groovy funk and soul that Stevie Wonder has been creating for decades. It’s a   on this list. He follows up: If you’re looking for an extra lift for the weekend, might I impose and suggest an extra Stevie gem from the same album. So, so good. (Submit a cover via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) Lance goes with a   pick —  Nada Surf’s cover of Depeche Mode’s “Enjoy the Silence”: I love this song because it takes a classic synthpop song and turns it into a classic power pop song. When I listen to the original, it’s hard for me to imagine it as a power pop song when I listen to the cover, it’s hard for me to imagine it as a synthpop song. The Nada Surf arrangement works on its own, without depending on knowledge of the original for its effect. (Submit a cover via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) I recently asked readers for their favorite Beatles covers, specifically ones that transcend the rock genre. One reader pointed to a   version of “She’s a Woman” while another highlighted an eclectic a cappella version of “Helter Skelter. ” This next reader gets right to the point: The Carpenters’s “Ticket To Ride. ” Brilliant. Period. End of sentence. Here’s some trivia regarding that song title, relayed by Don Short, a Daily Mirror music journalist: The girls who worked the streets in Hamburg had to have a clean bill of health and so the medical authorities would give them a card saying that they didn’t have a dose of anything. I was with The Beatles when they went back to Hamburg in June 1966 and it was then that John told me that he had coined the phrase ‘a ticket to ride’ to describe these cards. He could have been joking  —   you always had to be careful with John like that  —   but I certainly remember him telling me that. (Submit a song via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) A reader in NYC, David Leitner, has the perfect cover for the day: Marvin Gaye’s “Star Spangled Banner” is the ultimate song transformation. What only he could sing, solo with a beat box   …     If you have any   suggestions of your own, let us know and we’ll update. Update from Noam: This version is my fave because Sufjan [Stevens] captures the menace of it. The song is fundamentally about a war, and although patriotism compels us to ignore the fact that war is hell, this cover doesn’t. (Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) In response to my inquiry for the most   Beatles cover, Jay in Cincinnati remembers a truly unique, a cappella version of “Helter Skelter”: Somewhere in the   I was working late . .. really really late, after 3 A. M. late. Finally driving home, my brain competed with only two thoughts: staying conscious enough to survive the trip, and how good it would feel when I finally could collapse into bed. The radio was on —  nice and loud, to help me avoid nodding off, tuned to a small   station that played   music. When this song came on, it must have been close to 30 seconds before I even realized it was a song I knew. It was so different —  not just different from the original song, but from almost any kind of music I’d ever heard —  that for my own safety I pulled off the road so I could listen. Nobody identified what I’d heard they just kept playing more music. Sometimes on this station it could be 40 minutes before anyone came on to list what had been played. There were no cell phones, there was no internet. When I got home, I did not go to bed. I had to get a phone book, look up the station’s number and call. I had to know. Unlike today, when hardly any radio station in America has a live person on the air overnight, someone answered. I’ve since seen this group [The Bobs] in concert maybe ten times, occasionally planning   visits to other cities based on when they would be performing there. They’ve done covers of other famous songs, sometimes as radically different as this, but also in versions more recognizable. Mostly they sing their own songs, which range from hilarious to weird to touching. Every time I see them do this song, it brings back that night. Update from a reader in Bend, Oregon: I nominate Tiny Tim’s cover of the Beatles song “Girl. ” Tiny was generally not taken seriously, but he was very serious about music: When he burst into public recognition in 1968, people either regarded Tiny Tim as a lovable wacko, or simply a wacko though Tim’s eccentricity seemed both charming and oddly appropriate in the wake of the Summer of Love, despite his long hair and beatific attitude, he was no hippie, but instead an amateur archivist of American popular song who made it his life’s crusade to remind people about the joys of the Tin Pan Alley era. In his own odd way, Tiny Tim was one of the first artists of the rock era to celebrate the notion of the Great American songbook, though his fondness for a warbling falsetto delivery, his   wardrobe, his slightly fey personality, and his championing of the ukulele as his favored means of accompaniment was every bit as anomalous in 1968 as it would be today. While Tiny Tim was (principally) marketed as a novelty act and treated as a joke by many who presented him to the public (one of his most frequent television platforms was on Rowan and Martin’s  ) Tim wasn’t kidding    he loved and lived for this music, and he performed it in a historically accurate manner, remaining true to his musical vision right up to the very end . . . . This cover sounds both serious and wacky, and it bends the original song into such a bizarre vaudeville style that it is almost unrecognizable. Tiny’s vocal range is very wide, and gives the song a unique sound. I would guess that most people won’t like it, but here it is anyway. (Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.

2016-07-18,".@newtgingrich: Race relations are worse under a black President and a black Attorney General https:  .  Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich discussed the state of race relations in the United States in the wake of a spree of racially inspired violence, including shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge resulting in the deaths of eight police officers.  Gingrich argued much of the racial division is linked to President Barack Obama because of the   ’s attacks on the police. “At the risk of once again being divisive, I think as long as we have Barack Obama doing what he did over the last few years  —   you had     years of a black president,     years of a black attorney general. Gallup reports today race relations today than any time in the last 17 years. Why? Because how often has he hit the police? He hit the police in Cambridge and he was wrong. He hit the police in Ferguson. He was wrong. He hit the police in Florida. He was wrong. At what point does the president have some obligation to say  —   there are two parts to this  —   one, we’ve got to understand the experience of being black in America and in places like Chicago where 3, 200 people have been killed in the Obama presidency. We better have a strategy that works. We don’t. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
2016-07-19,"A snapshot of America in the middle of June 2016. It is several days before the first great shock of the summer, the Brexit vote, and here in America, all is serene. The threat posed by Senator Bernie Sanders has been suppressed. The Republicans have chosen a preposterous windbag to lead them the consensus is that he will be a pushover. For all the doubts and dissent of the last year, the leadership faction of the country’s professional class seem to have once again come out on top, and they are ready to accept the gratitude of the nation. And so President Barack Obama did an interview with Business Week in which he was congratulated for his stewardship of the economy and asked “what industries” he might choose to join upon his retirement from the White House. The president replied as follows:    …     what I will say is that  —   just to bring things full circle about innovation  —   the conversations I have with Silicon Valley and with venture capital pull together my interests in science and organization in a way I find really satisfying. In relating this anecdote, I am not aiming to infuriate because the man we elected in 2008 to get tough with high finance and shut the revolving door was now talking about taking his own walk through that door and getting a job in finance. No. My object here is to describe the confident, complacent mood of the country’s ruling class in the middle of last month. So let us continue. On the morning after British voters chose to leave the European Union, Obama was in California addressing an audience at Stanford University, a school often celebrated these days as the   educational institution of Silicon Valley. The occasion of the president’s remarks was the annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit, and the substance of his speech was the purest globaloney, flavored with a whiff of vintage dotcom ebullience. Obama marveled at the smart young creative people who start tech businesses. He deplored bigotry as an impediment that sometimes keeps these smart creative people from succeeding. He demanded that more power be given to the smart young creatives who are transforming the world. Keywords included “innovation” “interconnection” and of course “Zuckerberg” the Facebook CEO, who has appeared with Obama on so many occasions and whose company is often used as shorthand by Democrats to signify everything that is wonderful about our era. Everyone was down with the international entrepreneuriat in those sunny days. Less than a week after Obama’s salute to them at Stanford, Hillary Clinton paid a visit to an innovative   space in Denver and rolled out a plan for rewarding this very same cohort of     citizens. “Today’s dynamic and competitive global economy demands an ambitious national commitment to technology, innovation and entrepreneurship,” declared the “briefing” her campaign released on that occasion to make that commitment, Clinton proposed deferring the student loans of young people who start businesses   …     because I guess the promise of tech riches isn’t incentive enough. It felt so right, this Democratic infatuation with the triumphant young global professional. So right, and for a certain class of successful Americans, so very, very obvious. What you do with winners like these is you celebrate them. Winners need to win. Winners need to have their loan payments deferred, to have venture capital directed their way by a former president. That all these gestures might actually represent   behavior by an insular elite does not appear to have crossed our leaders’ minds in those complacent days of June 2016. But by the time of Hillary Clinton’s speech the happy, complacent mood was already beginning to crumble. Just a few days before her salute to tech winners came Brexit, a blunt and ugly rejection of some of her cohort’s most cherished ideas. A short while later came the FBI’s pronouncement on Hillary Clinton’s email practices, removing the threat of prosecution but not the aura of outrageous misbehavior. And then, like a drumbeat of horror, came a series of police shootings of black men, followed quickly by the murder of five policemen in Dallas. Over it all hung the fear that these events might somehow propel this unthinkable man, Donald Trump, into the White House. The world of accepted ideas was coming apart, and no one caught the new mood better than the New York Times’s David Brooks, a man who has spent his career describing the inner lives of the nation’s prosperous   elite. Ordinarily a dealer in witty aphorisms and   humor, Brooks now wrote a column entitled “Are We On the Path to National Ruin?” in which he speculated darkly about the possibility of fascism in America. “The crack of some abyss opened up for a moment by the end of last week,” he wrote. “It’s very easy to see this country on a nightmare trajectory. ”    is a pitiful sight, and one can’t help but sympathize. But what’s really remarkable about the response to these shocks of people like him has been their inability to acknowledge that their own satisfied   class might be part of the problem. On this they are utterly in denial and whatever the disaster, the answer they give is always   …     more of the same. More “innovation”. More venture capital. More sharp young global Stanford entrepreneurs. There is no problem that more people like they themselves can’t solve. Consider the New York Times   on the Brexit that ran on 7 July. It mocked the British government for being dominated by a tiny, incestuous circle of friends, but then reassured readers that things simply aren’t like that here in the USA: “It’s as if President Obama’s inner circle consisted almost entirely of his friends, neighbors and fellow Harvard graduates,” supposedly an impossibility. I had to read that passage over again and again to understand it, so great was the cognitive dissonance. President Obama’s inner circle does consist of his fellow Harvard graduates encouraging Obama to appoint such people and documenting their adventures in government has been a pundit obsession for years. Applauding Bill Clinton for doing the same with his Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law friends was also once a standard journalistic trope. And now, here it comes again. David Brooks, trying to see a way out of the “national ruin” that hovers over us, turns back to the foundational story of how our best and brightest rose to the challenge at the turn of the last century: New sorts of political leaders emerged. In city after city, progressive reformers cleaned up politics and professionalized the civil service. Theodore Roosevelt went into elective politics at a time when few Ivy League types thought it was decent to do so. Would it change Brooks’s mind to show him one of his own columns praising the man who now presides over our drift to “national ruin” for doing exactly what Brooks here suggests  —   ie, bringing many Ivy League types into politics with him? I doubt it, any more than it would be to ask Obama himself to take the problem of stagnant   wages into consideration before declaring, yet again, his admiration for the deeds of the global entrepreneuriat. It’s easy to see the problems presented by a cliquish elite when they happen elsewhere. In the countries of Old Europe, maybe, powerful politicians sell out grotesquely to Goldman Sachs but when an idealistic American president announces that he wants to seek a career in venture capital, we have trouble saying much of anything. In Britain, maybe, they have an “establishment” but what we have in America, we think, are talented people who deserve to be on top. One wonders what kind of a shock it will take to shake us out of this meritocratic complacency once and for all."
2016-07-20,"The second night of the Republican National Convention was a whipsaw of conflicting themes and messages. The printed schedule suggested a focus on jobs and economic policy. The reality: A party learning to acclimate itself to Donald J. Trump, figure out if he can win a national election, and help him (if possible). Our takeaways: They didn’t want him. They fought against him. Privately, they still resent him. But in the early minutes of the evening, as the party’s senior leadership executed a final quashing of lingering   efforts on the convention floor, they presided over Mr. Trump’s installation as the duly chosen Republican Party presidential nominee. They did it because the rules obligated them to, but also because it was politically necessary. If Trump loses the White House, it is imperative to the party’s establishment that he do so convincingly, undeniably, without sabotage, so that they cannot be blamed for the defeat. Ten minutes of Paul D. Ryan made that clear. In many respects, Mr. Ryan, the House speaker, delivered the classic speech of a major party nominee: papering over the nastiness of the primary, providing a positive vision of governing, and giving the party’s disparate factions a narrative they could all get behind. It was not the most original or soaring speech in convention history. But it was utterly different from virtually any Trump speech, or from most of the speeches by Mr. Trump’s surrogates on the convention stage so far. Mr. Ryan’s speech was a reminder of how unconventional Mr. Trump is  —   the quality that got him this far, but may now limit him. For all the controversy unfolding over the borrowed lines in Melania Trump’s remarks on Monday, two of Mr. Trump’s children gave the most effective and heartfelt speeches on Tuesday. Tiffany Trump, his    daughter with his second wife, sprinkled her speech with anecdotes about him making notes on her report cards and being the first to call her after the death of a good friend  —   the kind of softening material unexpectedly missing from his wife’s speech. Donald Trump Jr. an executive at the family business, gave a longer biographical tale of his father, told with sincerity and affection, dusted with a sprinkle of a Trumpian economic policy. (But just a sprinkle.) Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is famously competitive, so it was no surprise that he was let down when Mr. Trump passed him over for the ticket. But Mr. Christie’s speech seemed designed to make the nominee wonder if he had made a mistake. In contrast to the   Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, laid out a case against Hillary Clinton as though he were in a courtroom. It was hard not to remember that Mr. Trump once said he wanted an “attack dog” for his running mate, something that Mr. Pence, who has previously denounced negative campaigning, has not yet proved skilled at. Mr. Christie, in what may be the last major speech of his political career, reminded the hall  —   and maybe the nominee  —   that it is what he does best."
2016-07-21,"Mike Pence not only brings a strong gun rights record to the Republican ticket, but also a real history of warring against gun control while a U. S. Representative and, thereafter, the Governor of Indiana. [Here are eight of Pence’s greatest fights to kill gun control:  2003  —   Pence supported legislation to prevent the use of the court system as a backdoor method of bankrupting the gun manufacturers and sellers. The legislation was designed to prevent frivolous suits resulting over the “misuse of guns” that were legally made and sold. 2005  —   Pence supported the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). President George W. Bush signed PLCAA into law in October 2005 and to this day the law protects gun manufacturers and licensed gun dealers from frivolous suits over guns that were legally made and sold, then misused. Hillary Clinton has heavily criticized PLCAA during her campaign. She wants the law revisited and reversed so victims of gun crime can sue gun manufacturers and licensed gun dealers. 2007  —   On The Issues reports that Pence fought against gun registration for residents of Washington DC in 2007. 2009  —   Pence supported legislation to secure national reciprocity for concealed carry, thereby abolishing the cumbersome regulations that allow a permit holder to carry in his home state but not all others. The legislation was HR 197, which said, “Notwithstanding any law of any State, a person who is not prohibited by Federal law from possessing a firearm and is carrying a valid license to carry a concealed firearm may carry in another State a concealed firearm. ” The bill stated that if the state to which the permit holder traveled was a concealed carry state, then the permit holder was bound to follow the concealed laws of that state. If it was not a concealed carry state, he could still carry in it, but had to follow certain stipulations spelled out in HR 197. These stipulations included prohibitions on carrying in a police station, courthouse, etc. 2010  —   Pence   HR 1365, a resolution to commend the NRA for launching their “Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program. ” The text of HR 1365 said, “Commends the National Rifle Association for developing the Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program to teach firearm safety to children and supports the goals and objectives of such program. ” 2011  —   Pence   the Firearms Interstate Commerce Reform Act an act which would have “removed certain Federal restrictions on interstate firearms transactions. ” The act would have abolished barriers to gun purchases for military personnel and others who spend the majority of time in another state due to assignment   duty, thereby allowing them to purchase firearms when needed just as they would if they were back in their state of residence. 2014  —   As Governor of Indiana, Pence signed a bill allowing persons with concealed carry permits to keep a gun in their cars in school parking lots. This removed onerous gun controls placed on the backs of   parents or school employees simply for the act of driving onto school property. The bill also protected parents with concealed carry permits from being charged with felonies for possessing a gun while waiting in a parking area to pick their child up from school. After the bill was signed, Pence spoke to Real Clear Politics, saying: I have strongly supported the right to keep and bear arms. I truly believe that firearms in the hands of law abiding citizen’s makes our families and our communities more safe, not less safe. And the bill that we just signed here in Indiana really was a common sense reform. We actually have parents that had a permit to conceal and carry a weapon that we’re finding themselves guilty of a felony just by dropping their kids off to school. So we just  —   we made a modest change, a common sense change in Indiana law. And I strongly supported it. 2016  —   Governor Pence signed House Bill 1085 a bill which tightened otherwise cumbersome requirements, thereby streamlining the purchase of National Firearms Act (NFA) items. The   reported, “[HB 1085] requires a chief law enforcement officer (CLEO) to sign an application for the transfer of any item regulated under the NFA within 15 days if the applicant is not prohibited by law from receiving it. ” By requiring action within 15 days, HB 1085 “[removed] any possibility of personal bias and creating a statewide standard” for sales of   items.

2016-07-22,"ISTANBUL  —   The day after Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, declared a national state of emergency in the wake of a failed coup, an anxious nation awoke on Thursday to a text message from its leader, personally exhorting continued loyalty as the government moved against its enemies. Urging his supporters to maintain their presence in public squares, where they have flocked each evening since the coup attempt failed, he wrote, “Do not abandon the heroic resistance you have put up for your country, homeland and flag. ” Even as Turkish officials were more broadly trying to assure the public on Thursday that individual freedoms would not be threatened by the state of emergency, Mr. Erdogan’s message to nationwide cellphone customers struck a more martial tone. In particular, it carried a thinly veiled threat to a wide section of society that Mr. Erdogan views as his mortal enemy: the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a former ally and Muslim cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and whom the Turkish government has identified as the mastermind of the coup conspiracy. Turkish officials have demanded that the United States extradite him to face justice in Turkey. In his nationwide text message, Mr. Erdogan cast the nightly gatherings of his supporters in places like Taksim Square, in central Istanbul, as necessary to protect the country from Mr. Gulen. He wrote: “To teach the traitor, the terrorist”  —   a reference to Mr. Gulen’s following, which the Turkish government calls the Fethullah Terrorist Organization  —   “a lesson, continue your resistance and duty to guard democracy. The owners of our squares are not tanks, but the people. ” In the wake of the failed coup, which plunged the country into chaos after a night of violence that began late Friday, the government has moved quickly to purge from society tens of thousands of people now considered active or potential enemies. Some   generals and officers have been arrested on charges of plotting the coup, but thousands of soldiers, judges, teachers, police officers, governors and others either have been detained or have lost their jobs. All of them, according to the government, have links to Mr. Gulen. Mr. Gulen has denied any involvement in the coup plot, and insists that his movement within Turkey is peaceful. Now that Mr. Erdogan has declared a state of emergency, giving the state the power to bypass Parliament and pass laws that could possibly limit individual freedoms and suspend the rule of law for issues like pretrial detentions, many Turks are worried that the purge of suspected enemies will broaden. The concern is that Mr. Erdogan will target any and all opponents, not just those who are suspected of being followers of Mr. Gulen or of being linked to the coup. On Thursday, many saw a strong signal that that was already happening, as a prominent and widely regarded human rights lawyer, Orhan Kemal Cengiz, was detained in Istanbul, outraging human rights activists. The exact reason for his detention was unclear, but Mr. Cengiz has been a longtime critic of Mr. Erdogan’s government. “Orhan Kemal Cengiz is a respected human rights lawyer,” said Andrew Gardner, the Turkey researcher for Amnesty International. “He’s a columnist, and a lot of his work is about human rights issues. ” Some speculated that it was Mr. Cengiz’s work in the past for newspapers affiliated with Mr. Gulen, like Today’s Zaman, seized this year by the government, that led to his detention. If that was the case, it suggested that the government was using a very wide definition of who may be affiliated with Mr. Gulen. “He had worked for Today’s Zaman and other   newspapers,” Mr. Gardner said. “But he is in no way pushing editorial lines in his columns that are supportive of Fethullah Gulen. ” Mr. Cengiz, who was challenging in court the seizure by the government of Today’s Zaman and its   sister publication, Zaman, was detained at the airport on his way to London for a conference. Earlier in the week, Turkey effectively barred academics from traveling abroad. Still, Turkish officials on Thursday moved to assure the public that the state of emergency would not lead to the widespread curtailment of individual freedoms, and that the government would focus only on targeting suspected coup plotters. “I want to guarantee that fundamental rights and freedoms and normal daily life will not be affected by this,” Numan Kurtulmus, a deputy prime minister, told reporters in Ankara, the capital. As required of a member of the Council of Europe, Turkey said it was suspending its participation in the European Convention on Human Rights, as France did after the terrorist attacks in Paris last year. Officials also sought to contain the economic fallout from Turkey’s crisis, even though the value of the Turkish lira has already plunged against the dollar. “Life of ordinary people and businesses will go unimpacted, uninterrupted, business will be as usual,” Mehmet Simsek, a deputy prime minister and former finance minister, said in an interview with NTV, a private broadcaster. Also on Thursday, a court in Alexandroupolis in northern Greece sentenced eight Turkish military officers who fled to Greece on a helicopter after the failed coup to two months in prison, finding them guilty of illegal entry into the country. The Turkish officers’ sentence was suspended for three years, but the eight were detained pending the outcome of their requests for political asylum in Greece. Turkey has called on Greece to swiftly extradite the officers, who have claimed that they were not involved in the coup but that they fled the country in fear of their lives. Mr. Erdogan has used the failed coup to whip up the emotions of his religiously conservative base of supporters, representing roughly half the country. That has intensified concerns that the president’s provocative language could lead to lasting divisions, and possibly incite more violence. Earlier in the week, a banner seen flying over Taksim Square, seemingly a message from Erdogan supporters to Mr. Gulen and his followers, promised as much: “We will hang you and your dogs by your own leashes. ”"
2016-07-23,"  A gunman opened fire at a Munich McDonald’s and then at a shopping mall, killing nine people Friday evening. So far, there are more questions after yet another deadly rampage in Europe.  What happened: The gunman started shooting at the McDonald’s, then moved across the street to the Olympia shopping mall on Friday.  Hours after the shooting began, police found the body of the gunman. Based on CCTV and witness statements, they concluded he was the sole gunman. He was found dead close to the shopping center, in a side street. The motive remains unclear.  Weapon:  The attacker carried a 9 mm Glock 17 pistol that was likely obtained illegally, because the serial number had been scratched off, police said. Germany has strict gun laws and a national firearms registry that requires owners to register their guns with the government. The gunman was found armed with about 300 munition cartridges for the handgun, but there were no explosives in his backpack.  Victims:  Authorities said nine people were killed, excluding the gunman, and 27 were injured, 10 with serious injuries.  The victims’ identities have not been released.  Most of the victims were teenagers. Three of the victims were 14, two were 15, one was 17 and another 19. A    and a    were also killed. Three of the victims were female, officials said. The victims all were German nationals from the Munich area, officials said. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said three of the victims were also Turkish nationals, naming them as Sevda Dag, born in 1971 Can Leyla, born in 2001 and Selcuk Kilic, according to Turkey’s semiofficial Anadolu news agency. Another of the victims was also a Greek citizen, Greece’s Foreign Ministry said Saturday. Shooter: German police have not named the shooter, but they have said he was an    student with dual   nationality who was born and raised in Munich, and that they have searched his family’s apartment. CNN’s Atika Shubert interviewed people who live in that building, and they identified the    living in that apartment as Ali Sonboly. In a press conference Saturday, German police said the gunman’s parents had been taken in for questioning. The shooter had received medical treatment for mental issues, a police official said Saturday in a press conference, and investigators are still looking into his mental condition. Authorities said the teen was a mentally troubled man who had extensively researched rampage killings but had no apparent religious or political motives. Before Friday’s attack, the police had not investigated the teenager. He had been a victim of ”bodily harm” in an incident that involved other young people in 2012 and was the victim of theft in 2011, police said on Saturday. The parents of the attacker have so far been unable to help police during questioning as they were still in shock over the shooting.  German police have not named the shooter, but they have said he was an    student with dual   nationality who was born and raised in Munich. CNN’s Atika Shubert interviewed people who live in that building, and they identified the teenager living in that apartment as Ali Sonboly. Witnesses:  Witnesses said the gunman shot at young people, but it’s unclear if he was targeting them specifically. He fired into a McDonald’s where kids had been eating.  One witness said the gunman cursed foreigners while carrying out his attack and was overheard yelling: ”You damn foreigners.”  During the rampage, the shooter got into an argument with a witness and their   conversation was captured on two camera phones and posted on social media. The shooter was heard saying: ”I am German. Are you happy now? I was born here . ..” He insulted Turks in the exchange. Motive: The shooter was a ”lone attacker” and there was no indication of ties with ISIS, said Munich Police Chief Hubertus Andrae. Investigators searched his home and found neither reference to religion nor a suicide note.  But officers found evidence the shooter had been researching shooting rampages, including a book entitled ”Rampage in My Mind    Why Students Kill,” according to Robert Heimberger, president of the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office.  Munich investigators said there were ”certain connections” between the Friday attack and the 2011 mass shooting by Anders Breivik in Norway which left 77 people dead exactly five years earlier. Investigators pointed to several connections: the date of the shooting was the fifth anniversary of the Norway attack, the age of the victims was similar and the attacker extensively researched mass shootings."
2016-07-24,"My    lives far away. She calls to check in every week or so and runs through a laundry list of topics: her husband, their kids, their dog. She has a million stories. Trouble is, by the time she’s finished, her time is up: “Gotta go!” This leaves no room for me to share my news. So while I know her son’s ACT scores, she wouldn’t be able to tell you the first thing about my family. This has been going on for over a year. Is there a way to point out the imbalance that won’t make me sound needy or her  ? VALERIE, CONN. I have a newish therapist, and I’m going away for a spell this summer. So I asked if he would consider phone sessions. “Absolutely not!” he said, with a look that verged on repulsion. In his experience, patients on the phone often interpret silence as a signal to keep talking, leading to 50 minutes of blather. Perhaps this notion, combined with the fact that your    seems to be initiating all these calls, explains her conversational dominance. (Or maybe she’s a narcissistic witch.) One idea: Try dialing the phone yourself. It’s conceivable that your    will back off a little, and you will become “Charles in Charge” for the length of the calls that you place. If not, here’s another: Though I have preached for years that we should pick up the phone at the first sign of trouble in our   do the opposite here. After your next   call, send her an email: “Your story about Charlie’s ACT’s made me think of a funny one from when Sarah took them. Remind me to tell you when we next speak. ” Then do so at the beginning of your next call. She may get the hang of taking turns. Now, this advice is predicated on the assumption that your    is a good person with an annoying phone tic, and that normal attempts to jostle your way into the conversation have failed. But we may have different definitions of jostling. There’s no crime in saying: “Hang on! You won’t believe what your brother did,” after she tells you a story about her husband. Not every conversationalist will lay out the red carpet for us. Sometimes we have to make our own breaks. My husband and I married last September. We have a surprising number of friends who attended the wedding but have not yet sent gifts. We had a small registry that sold out quickly, so some folks probably saw that it was sold out, made a mental note to buy something else, then forgot. It’s not a big deal to us. But we’re worried that some friends got us gifts that may have been lost at the wedding or in the mail, and they are now wondering why we haven’t sent them   notes. What should we do? DAVID, NEW YORK I applaud the mental gymnastics of trying to turn your “surprising number” of    friends into victims of the United States Postal Service. (You and your hubby should head to Rio for spots on the Olympic tumbling squad.) For every package that is not delivered, millions are. And absent some catastrophic event at your wedding reception, I suspect you are in possession of all of the presents left for you there, too. Don’t obsess over tiny risks. The trick here is turning your friends’ attendance at your wedding into the big prize. Because that’s all you’re getting. Sorry. If you want to send them   notes for being part of your big day, knock yourself out. But it seems over the top to me. For what it’s worth, your assessment of the situation  —     registry leading to giftlessness  —   seems about right. Next time, register for everything in sight. (Books, anyone?) I came across a travel package to Japan that sounded perfect for my husband and me. He mentioned it to his running buddy, who immediately said that he and his wife were in: “We’d love to join you. ” Philip, they weren’t invited! It’s a   trip, and we’ve never traveled together before. More important, they are not adventurous eaters, and I don’t want to spend my limited travel time scouting for Americanized food in Asia. Fortunately, the trip was sold out. Now, another has come up, but I’m afraid that Japan is off the table if we want to travel alone. Isn’t it too risky to book the trip and try to keep it top secret? C. S. NEW JERSEY Has anyone else noticed that it seems to be masochist week at Social Q’s? Don’t let impromptu statements by your husband’s running buddies dictate your travel schedule. Book your vacation and hold your head high. No need for secrecy. When your husband (inevitably) mentions the trip to his friend, coach him to say, “We decided to make it a second honeymoon and go alone. ” Your objections to   travels with this couple sound sensible, but no reason is required. Propose a long weekend to the Berkshires instead. (But only if you want to go with them.)"

Please follow the steps below, In February 2011, the Washington Post published a survey it conducted with the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University on the U. S. economy. Although black and Hispanic families were hurt by the Great Recession, it was the ”  whites” who held the darkest view of the country. These men used to the the backbone of an economy built by brawn and rooted in manufacturing jobs. But now, nostalgic and despondent in equal measure, more than half said that America’s best days were past, and 43 percent said ”hard work and determination are no guarantees of success. ” The survey feels portentous now that the category of “  whites” has become the core demographic of Donald Trump’s astonishingly strong coalition. Trump’s support is driven by racism, xenophobia, and other varieties of cultural unease, but it is also a reflection of a lost generation of men, enraged and adrift in an economy where a college degree is one of the few dependable life rafts.   men in their 40s and older are shocking the country with their turn toward nationalism. But what’s the situation among   men under 35? If good, steady,   work is the key to any person’s economic satisfaction, there are several reasons to be nervous about the upcoming generation. Since 2000, the   participation rate of young men without a college degree has declined more than any other    group. Since the turn of the century, the participation rate of     olds with just a   degree has fallen 10 points to about 70 percent for those without even a   degree, it’s fallen 20 points, to 30 percent. Some of this drop is attributable to rising college attendance. But not all of it. Nine percent of Americans between 20 and 24 are neither in school, work, or training. So where do these men live? What are they doing all day? The answer to the first question seems to be that more of them are living at home. For the first time since at least the 1940s, young men are more likely to be living with their parents than with romantic partners. In 2014, 35 percent of young men between 18 and 34 lived with their parents, compared to just 28 percent who lived with a spouse. It’s not the cost of college or the weight of student loans alone that is forcing young people to stay home. Young adults without a   or college degree are far more likely to live with their parents. For young black men, this trend is hardly new even in 1980, they were more likely to live with their parents than with a spouse or girlfriend. As for what they’re doing all day, Erik Hurst, an economist at the University of Chicago, is now conducting research that suggests that   men who aren’t in the labor market are spending a considerable amount of their time in front of screens. Here is how Hurst explained his preliminary findings in a “Faculty Spotlight” profile on the University of Chicago’s website,  as noted by the economist Tyler Cowen on his blog: In the 2000s, employment rates for young men with less than a   degree dropped sharply  —   more than in any other group. We have determined that, in general, they are not going back to school or switching careers, so what are they doing with their time? The hours that they are not working have been replaced almost one for one with leisure time.   percent of this new leisure time falls into one category: video games. [Emphasis mine] Detached from the labor force, with neither a college degree nor a steady job, these men have little income. But the technological revolution in media and entertainment of the last few decades has made it cheaper than ever to divert oneself on a phone, computer, television, or   console. Leisure is cheap enough that it apparently doesn’t require a steady   or 1099 to have fun. And they are having fun, Hurst emphasized. “Happiness surveys actually indicate that they [are] quite content compared to their peers,” he told UChicago. In the short run, not working doesn’t seem to make men miserable at all. Cheap and abundant entertainment anesthetizes   and   young men in the present. But in the long run, it cuts them off from the same things that provide meaning in middle age, according to psychological and longitudinal studies  —  a career, a family, and a sense of accomplishment. The problem is that these    will eventually be    and    and although young men who don’t go to college might appear happy now, those same satisfaction studies suggest that they will be much less happy in their 30s and 40s —  less likely to get married, and more likely to be in poverty. There is a rising generation of   men, cut off from steady employment, but, for the moment, diverted by entertainment. They are, as far as Hurst can tell, not miserable now and yet, there is little precedent for a large and highly satisfied group of     men living in poverty in an advanced economy. “This problem, if that is the right word for it, will not be easily solved,” Cowen wrote on his blog. If these men back a political movement, it probably won’t look much like today’s Trumpist’s coalition. After all, Trump’s support skews heavily white, and many of today’s young men who didn’t graduate high school are black and Hispanic. But one possible lesson of this election is that feelings of cultural isolation and economic despondency are ingredients in a noxious and unpredictable compound, which can combust in surprising ways. Another mix may be brewing."
2016-07-26,"Twitter is battling for a share of the internet’s booming video advertising budgets, its executives said on Tuesday, as the company reported its slowest growth in quarterly revenue since going public in 2013. Facing increasing competition from   competitors such as Snapchat and Instagram, Twitter is attempting to encourage users to stay longer on the platform by adding more live video content from Periscope and on Twitter itself.  It has signed 250 media partners across politics, sports and entertainment, introducing ways to watch live video and simultaneously comment including live broadcasts of the Republican and Democratic party conventions in July. “We’re working every day to make Twitter faster and more intuitive to use,” said its CEO, Jack Dorsey, “introducing changes to the timeline, character count and reply rules. We have exciting momentum on live video on Periscope and on Twitter. ” Adam Bain, Twitter’s chief operating officer, said that video now accounts for the majority of Twitter’s advertising revenue. “One year ago those products [Twitter’s video advertising offering] did not exist,” he said. “There’s a whole new set of video budgets out there  —   a $10bn marketplace in the US alone. ” Bain said there had been strong demand for advertising around its NFL content, including the brands Sony, Nestlé, Verizon and  .  Twitter’s user base, however, modestly increased to 313 million average monthly active users in the second quarter, up from 310 million in the first quarter. The company, which has been struggling with stagnating user growth and lower spending by advertisers, is doubling down on efforts to attract users. Under Dorsey, the company is working to better define its role in the growing social media landscape. Twitter rolled out a video ad this week that showed it as the place to go for live news, updates and discussion about current events.  The microblogging service operator’s shares plunged 10% in extended trading as revenue for the quarter fell short of analysts’ estimates. Revenue forecast for the current quarter also came in below estimates. Twitter forecast current quarter revenue of $ $610m, well below the average analyst estimate of $678. 18m.  Excluding items, the company earned 13 cents per share, topping the average analyst estimate of 10 cents.  The company’s net loss narrowed to $107. 2m, or 15 cents a share, in the second quarter ended 30 June, from $136. 7m, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose about 20% to $602m, missing the estimate of $606. 8m. "

Loeb’s Third Point acted quickly following the UK vote on June 23  —   jumping into US equities when they tumbled following Brexit and then profiting as stocks gained 4. 9 percent from their decline before the end of the month. For the month, Third Point gained 4. 6 percent in the second quarter, according to an investor letter released Wednesday. David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital, in a letter on Tuesday, pointed to the Brexit bounce to help explain a profit from its short positions. While returns in the broader hedge fund industry are trending lower compared to previous years, the UK trading opportunity helped to brighten that narrative. Third Point said problems like “copycat investment frameworks” and some managers failing to have a macro view should be addressed."
2016-07-28," What we just witnessed in Cleveland and Philadelphia defies our normal political vocabulary. We are used to speaking of American politics as split between the two major parties. It’s Democrats versus Republicans, liberals versus conservatives, left versus right.    But not this election. The conventions showed that this is something different. This campaign is not merely a choice between the Democratic and Republican parties, but between a normal political party and an abnormal one. The Democratic Party’s convention was a normal political party’s convention. The party nominated Hillary Clinton, a longtime party member with deep experience in government. Clinton was endorsed by Bernie Sanders, the   in the primary. Barack Obama, the sitting president, spoke in favor of Clinton. Various Democratic luminaries gave speeches endorsing Clinton by name. The assembled speakers criticized the other party’s nominee, arguing that he would be a bad president and should be defeated at the polls. That isn’t to say that Democrats didn’t show divisions or expose fault lines. They did. Political parties are chaotic things. The Democratic Party’s primary was unusually bitter, and listening to the loud ”boos” of Sanders’s most committed supporters, there’s real reason to wonder whether Democrats will fracture in coming years. But for now, the Democrats nominated a normal candidate, held a normal convention, and remain a normal political party.    Republicans held an abnormal convention and nominated an abnormal candidate The Republican Party’s convention was not a normal political party’s convention. The party nominated Donald Trump, a new member with literally no experience in government. Ted Cruz, the   in the primary, gave a primetime speech in which he refused to endorse Trump, and instead told Americans to ”vote your conscience.”    The Republican Party’s two living presidents, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, declined to endorse Trump or attend the convention. The party’s previous two presidential nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, declined to endorse Trump or attend the convention. The assembled speakers  —   including Chris Christie, a prospective attorney general  —   argued that the other party’s nominee was a criminal who should be thrown in jail.             Even the normal parts of the convention felt abnormal. The prospective first lady’s speech included a passage plagiarized from the Democratic Party’s first lady. Trump counterprogrammed the first night of his own convention by doing a phone interview with Fox News and an   discussion with the Golf Channel. He distracted from his running mate’s acceptance speech by telling the New York Times he would not automatically honor America’s commitments under the NATO treaty. Trump’s speech was enthusiastically endorsed by David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. ”Couldn’t have said it better,” he tweeted.    Trump’s   was even worse The strangeness didn’t end with the convention. The next day  —   the very next day!  —   Trump gave a press conference in which he said Ted Cruz’s father was likely involved in the assassination of JFK, swore he wouldn’t accept Cruz’s endorsement even if it were offered, and argued that the National Enquirer deserved a Pulitzer Prize. It was one of the strangest and most   political performances in recent memory. The conservative Weekly Standard was left agog. The Republican Party’s nominee, Stephen Hayes wrote, ”is not of sound mind.” Then, befitting the dignity we expect in our presidential aspirants, the Republican Party’s nominee spent his week   the Democratic Party’s convention, with deep, thoughtful commentary like:   The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2016    And:   Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2016    He followed that up with a press conference at which he blasted the job Tim Kaine had done in   …     New Jersey? Of course, Kaine was the governor of Virginia. Trump seems to have literally confused the Democrats’ vice presidential nominee with Tom Kean, the former Republican governor of New Jersey.    Unwilling to stop there, Trump went on to comment on the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s emails, which most experts think was conducted by Russia. ”Russia, if you are listening, I hope you are able to find the 33, 000 emails that are missing  —   I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,” he said. Let’s stop there for a second: Donald Trump went out and asked a foreign government to conduct cyber espionage in order to help his campaign. His supporters initially tried to laugh it off as an   joke, but then Trump tweeted the same thing. This came only hours after his running mate, Mike Pence, had warned of ”serious consequences” if Russia truly was behind the DNC hack. None of this is normal. A new cleavage in American politics: normal versus abnormal America’s main political cleavage is between the Democratic and Republican parties. That split has meant different things at different times, but in recent decades it primarily tracks an ideological disagreement: Democrats are the party of liberal policies; Republicans are the party of conservative policies. But in this year’s presidential election, the difference is more fundamental than that: The Democratic Party is a normal political party that has nominated a normal presidential candidate, and the Republican Party has become an abnormal political party that has nominated an abnormal presidential candidate.            Simply saying that will raise people’s partisan hackles, but it’s not a partisan comment. Republicans know that Donald Trump is not a normal nominee. They know this isn’t what their 2012 convention looked like or how their 2008 convention felt. And while most Republicans fear Democrats keeping the White House enough to unhappily support Trump, it’s worth listening to what they’ve said about him. Ted Cruz called Trump a ”pathological liar,” ”utterly amoral,” and ”a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen.”    Rick Perry said Trump’s candidacy was ”a cancer on conservatism, and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised, and discarded.” National Review, the flagship journal of American conservatism, said Trump ”is a menace to American conservatism.” Rand Paul said Trump is ”a delusional narcissist and an   windbag. A speck of dirt is way more qualified to be president.” A list like this could go on, and on, and on. But here’s the point: These aren’t normal political condemnations. This isn’t normal political language. Republicans know they’ve nominated a dangerous man. They tried to warn their voters in the strongest terms possible that Trump is unqualified, untrustworthy, and amoral. Michael Bloomberg, the former Republican mayor of New York City, put it simply in a speech endorsing Clinton. ”Together, let’s elect a sane, competent person,” he said. That is what an endorsement sounds like when the choice shifts from left versus right to normal versus abnormal. There are some differences in politics that transcend ideology. This is one of them. Clinton, say what you will about her, is a normal political candidate who will operate within the normal boundaries of American democracy. Donald Trump is an abnormal political candidate; we have no idea which democratic boundaries he would respect, which conspiracy theories he would believe, which political enemies he would punish, which treaties he would honor.    Trump has already been scolded by his own party for racist comments, for attacks on the judiciary, for undermining the NATO alliance, for inviting foreign governments to meddle in American elections. None of this is okay. None of it is normal. This is not a man with the temperament, the steadiness, or the discipline to be president. This election puts Republicans in a hard position. Even as the choice in this election is between a normal candidate and an abnormal one, it’s also between a liberal candidate and a, well,   one. I don’t doubt Trump would nominate   judges, or that he would resist raising taxes. I understand why so many Republicans have decided to suppress their doubts and support him. But this is a dangerous game. We are a nation protected by norms, not just by laws. Our political parties should be held to certain standards in terms of the candidates they nominate, the behaviors they accept, the ideas they mainstream. Trump violates those standards. By indulging him, the Republican Party is normalizing him and his behavior, and making itself abnormal. "
2016-07-29,"  On a historic night, Hillary Clinton proved that a woman nominee for president can deliver just as good an acceptance speech as a man    and some would say, even better. Clinton is more adept at debates than in public speeches, but her sweeping,   and sometimes moving acceptance address was one of her most effective performances. Unlike most speakers in Philadelphia, she put jobs and terror front and center in her campaign    just where they belong. She also delivered one of best attack lines against Donald Trump: ”A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” Join us on Facebook.  Even so, it is questionable whether she and her team made the right call in skirting around the elephant in the room: the high levels of distrust felt toward her that could cost her victory in November.   From experience in past presidential campaigns, I am sympathetic with their decision to remain silent: It would definitely have been a risky play, probably drawing headlines away from her more positive message and perhaps converting few voters.  Even so, I thought they made a mistake. Bobby Kennedy liked to quote an old saying, ”Hang a lantern on your problem.” Clinton seemed to be moving in that direction several days ago, humbly acknowledging that many don’t trust her and that she needs to work on it. That admission made her more real and credible.   ”Well,” say friends, ”what can she do about it? How can she turn things around?”  For starters, she ought to be aggressively finding ways to be much more transparent and accountable. Her news conferences are rare they need to happen frequently. She needs to release transcripts from her past speeches to Wall Street audiences. As she did at her convention, she needs to bring a bevy of speakers to public attention who can testify from working with her how trustworthy she is. And she needs to begin mapping out plans for an administration that would be far more open than those of the recent past, including the governments of George W. Bush and Barack Obama.  Public leaders in America, Europe and much of the world are now facing a growing crisis of public distrust.  As the first woman nominee in U. S. presidential politics, wouldn’t it be exhilarating if Hillary Clinton could also be a pioneer in raising standards in politics?"
2016-07-30,"PARIS (AP)  —   A teenager detained following the gruesome killing of an    priest by a pair of jihadi attackers in northwest France was released Saturday, a French official said. [An official with the Paris prosecutor’s office said investigators questioning the    found evidence of regular visits to jihadi sites and of “incitement to terrorism,” but that the minor’s case had been handed over to prosecutors in the nearby city of Rouen who cover the region. She spoke on condition of anonymity as she was not allowed to be named publicly.  Judicial authorities in Rouen did not immediately return a message seeking comment. A Syrian refugee and a cousin of one of the two attackers remain in custody following the July 26 attack in the French town of     which claimed the life of Rev. Jacques Hamel as he celebrated morning Mass. The violence sent shockwaves around France and deeply touched many among the nation’s 5 million Muslims. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, as well as the July 14 truck attack in Nice, where 84 people were killed by a man who plowed a truck down a seaside promenade. France has seen rising jihadi violence in the past 18 months, with attacks against journalists, Jews, police and partygoers. The deadliest violence struck Paris on Nov. 13, when Muslim fanatics targeted Paris’ Bataclan concert hall, restaurants and a stadium, killing 130 people and wounding hundreds more. In a separate development, two men suspected of connections to the Paris attacks were extradited Friday from Austria to France. The men, identified by Austrian authorities as a    from Pakistan and a    from Algeria, are believed to have come to Europe last year posing as refugees. French authorities have said the men were handed preliminary charges of “criminal terrorist association. ” In yet another development, the official with the Paris prosecutor’s office said that an unnamed man detained in the wake of the Nice truck attack would be sent to Paris on Monday, a step toward preliminary charges. The man is suspected of being the person who posed for a selfie with the driver Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel in the cab of the vehicle used in the attack, she said."
2016-07-31," Hillary Clinton is heading to heavily Republican Nebraska on Monday in search of a single electoral vote. In a move that suggests the Democratic presidential nominee is taking nothing for granted against Republican Donald Trump, Clinton has scheduled a late afternoon rally in Omaha, a moderate pocket of an otherwise conservative state. Here’s why: Nebraska is one of only two states that awards part of its electoral votes based on outcomes in congressional districts. The other is Maine. In Nebraska’s case, two of the state’s five electoral votes go to the statewide winner. That is almost certain to be Trump. The other three are distributed on the basis of performance in Nebraska’s three congressional districts.  [How Clinton and Sanders avoided a broken convention]  In 2008,  . Barack Obama (Ill.) edged out GOP nominee John McCain in the 2nd Congressional District, which includes Omaha, picking up exactly one of the 270 electoral votes needed nationwide to secure the presidency.  Four years later, Mitt Romney swept the entire state, which has pretty much been the norm for Republicans in recent decades. Bud Synhorst, executive director of the Nebraska Republican Party, said he considered Obama’s 2008   “pretty much of a fluke. ” “I think Clinton is wasting her time and money,” Synhorst said. “She thinks she can pull an Obama, but she’s not the same candidate, and it’s eight years later. ” Democrats, however, say they are pretty fired up about the visit, scheduled for a high school gym that won’t be nearly large enough to fit everyone who has already RSVP’d, according to Nebraska Democratic Party Chairman Vincent Powers. Powers said that after consulting with others on Facebook, he determined that a Democrat hadn’t campaigned in Nebraska during the general election since President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought reelection in 1936. “It’s been 80 years,” Powers said. “We’re just very happy she’s coming. For us in Nebraska, it’s a huge development to have a future president campaigning here. ” Obama came to Nebraska ahead of the 2008 Democratic caucuses but did not return before the general election, Powers said. “Unless you come and ask for our vote, you’re not going to get our vote,” said Powers, adding that he has been annoyed by those in the national media who consider Nebraska a state that Democrats “should just fly over. ” Unlike other parts of the state, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh doesn’t dominate the airwaves in Omaha, Powers added. “There’s a lot more to listen to on the radio,” he added. Omaha is Nebraska’s largest city and home to a handful of Fortune 500 companies as well as the annual College World Series. It is telling that Clinton considers the   district a battleground. Her campaign has staff on the ground there and is airing television ads in the Omaha market. Only eight states have been afforded the same status: Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. (Pennsylvania is relatively new to the list, having replaced Colorado, a state targeted in an earlier Clinton ad buy.) Republicans have speculated that Clinton’s stand in Omaha is really more about shoring up support in Iowa, a swing state on Nebraska’s eastern border. The Omaha TV market bleeds over into western Iowa, including Council Bluffs, which is just across the river. The Clinton campaign insists otherwise. During last week’s Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, a   Clinton campaign official made a point of visiting a Nebraska delegation breakfast. “We are campaigning in Nebraska for your congressional district,” said Marlon Marshall, the campaign’s director of states and political engagement, according to an account in the Omaha  . “We feel very strongly that we can win. ” The state GOP doesn’t plan to be particularly welcoming when Clinton touches down on Monday. Groups of military veterans opposed to her policies are planning to greet her both at the airport and the event site, Synhorst said. “We have a couple other things planned for her that she’ll find out about when she gets here,” he added.

2016-08-01,"The residents of a Midtown   were promised a building of “premier luxury caliber”  —   but all they got was a crumbling, leaky mess, a $67 million lawsuit charges. When The Alexander was being built on East 49th Street near Second Avenue in 2008, its developer promised amenities like an Equinox gym and roof decks, as well as fine touches such as marble and bronze elevators and   flooring, according to the suit by the building’s condo owners. But the   building is now rife with dangerous code violations and sloppy, unfinished work, the owners charge in the suit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court last week against developer Alexander Gurevich and others. Gurevich “represented to prospective purchasers that the Turtle Bay condominium and its units would be of a premier luxury caliber and would be designed and constructed with the highest quality of materials and workmanship,” the suit says. “However, this was not the case at all. ” The suit says cracks and leaks permeate the building, including on the roof, balconies and terraces, causing water to flood some condos  —   which, according to the real estate website StreetEasy, sell for as much as $1. 9 million for a  . Cracked glass on the common roof deck is held together with clear tape, and windows aren’t sealed properly to keep out drafts and noise, the suit says.   roof tiles are loose and in danger of falling, and no emergency signs were ever installed, the suit says. The   board of managers says several   amenities promised in the building’s “offering plan” are nonexistent, too. A promised gym, “  room” for   deliveries and mail room were never built, the suit says. The manager panel claims in the complaint that The Alexander’s initial board was stacked with Gurevich cronies who failed to pay the building’s water and sewer bills for five years. Now, they say, condo owners will have to shell out roughly $320, 000 as part of a   repayment plan, with another $122, 000 in interest. “The board felt it was very necessary to pursue these claims based on the various conditions alleged in their complaint,” said their lawyer, Steven Sladkus. The suit also names the building’s manager, Taube Management Realty, and its designer, Sydness Architects, as defendants. In 2010,   General Andrew Cuomo barred Gurevich from real estate sales for three years after alleging that he failed to disclose key financial information to investors at The Alexander. Gurevich and Taube did not return messages. Jeff Sydness, who owns Sydness Architects, said he had not seen the suit and could not comment."

Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF  The   shooting death of Korryn Gaines, a    black woman, is bringing attention to women killed by law enforcement and the threats officers face after a turbulent month of shooting incidents. Authorities said Gaines was shot and killed by police officers on Monday when they arrived at her apartment in Randallstown, Maryland, outside of Baltimore, to serve arrest warrants and she “pointed a gun at them and threatened to kill them. ” The Washington Post details the incident: The man was wanted on an assault charge, while Gaines, 23, had an arrest warrant for failing to appear in court after a traffic violation in March. According to police, no one responded to 10 minutes of door knocking, even though they could hear several people inside. When officers obtained a key to the apartment, they found Gaines sitting on the floor  —   her    son was wrapped in one of her arms. In her other hand was a shotgun. Around 3 p. m. after several hours of negotiation, police say Gaines raised the gun at officers and told them that she would kill them if they did not leave. The officers opened fire. NBC reports that “the officers involved in the incident will be placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated. ” In Tennessee v. Garner, the Supreme Court ruled that “the Fourth Amendment prohibits the use of deadly force unless it is necessary to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of violence to the officer or the community. ” Gaines’s death also highlights the other women who have been killed by law enforcement: Nine, including Gaines, have been fatally shot by police officers this year, according to a Washington Post database. On Twitter, users began posting the hashtag #SayHerName to call attention to these women’s deaths and “other women of color who have been killed by police. ” A recent series of shooting incidents have led to protests and rallies across the United States. In Minnesota and Louisiana, two   shooting deaths claimed the lives of two African American men in July in Dallas, an ambush killed five police officers. The events solicited responses from leaders including President Obama, who condemned the shootings and called for unity.  Last week, at the Democratic National Convention, “Mothers of the Movement” recalled the children who have died as a result of law enforcement or gun violence, just as relatives of slain officers mourned their loss. The message was clear: Violence, whether from or against the police, is an everyday challenge in communities across the United States. On Tuesday, officers arrested two men in Massachusetts after allegedly planning to kill police."
2016-08-03,"Washington  The Obama administration secretly arranged a plane delivery of $400 million in cash on the same day Iran released four American prisoners and formally implemented the nuclear deal, US officials confirmed Wednesday. President Barack Obama approved the $400 million transfer, which he had announced in January as part of the Iran nuclear deal. The money was flown into Iran on wooden pallets stacked with Swiss francs, euros and other currencies as the first installment of a $1. 7 billion settlement resolving claims at an international tribunal at The Hague over a failed arms deal under the time of the Shah.  A fifth American man was released by Iran separately. Details of the cash delivery drew fresh condemnation of the Iran deal from Republicans. They charged that the administration had empowered a major sponsor of terrorism because the nuclear agreement enables Tehran to   the international economy and gives it access   funds.  In addition, they said the cash delivery amounted to a ransom payment that violates   US practice not to pay for hostages. As such, they argued, it encourages Iran to hold onto its remaining Americans prisoners until they can get more money for them.  ”Paying ransom to kidnappers puts Americans even more at risk,” said Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk. ”While Americans were relieved by Iran’s overdue release of illegally imprisoned American hostages, the White House’s policy of appeasement has led Iran to illegally seize more American hostages, including Siamak Namazi, his father Baquer Namazi and Reza Shahini.” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump jumped on the issue, seeking to change the subject after a punishing week of gaffes and reproaches from members of the GOP.  ”Iran was in big trouble, they had sanctions, they were dying, we took off the sanctions and made this horrible deal and now they’re a power,” Trump said Wednesday in Daytona, Florida.  ”We paid $400 million for the hostages,” Trump said. ”Such a bad precedent was set by Obama. We have two more hostages there right? What’s are we going to pay for them? What we’re doing is insane.” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, when asked about the payment by a local Denver, Colorado, television station, said it was ”old news.” ”It was first reported about seven or eight months ago, as I recall,” she told Denver’s 9News. ”And, so far as I know, it had nothing to do with any kind of hostage swap or any other   . It was something that was intended to, as I am told, pay back Iran for contracts that were canceled when the Shah fell.” US officials said cash had to be flown in because existing US sanctions ban American dollars from being used in a transaction with Iran and because Iran could not access the global financial system due to international sanctions it was under at the time. The details of the how the transaction occurred were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. CNN reported in January that the transfer of funds had been arrangement. The money was procured from central banks in Switzerland and the Netherlands, official said, and an unmarked cargo plane loaded with Swiss francs, euros and other currencies were flown to Iran. ”They were totally cut off from global banks and there was no other way to get them the money,” one senior official with knowledge of the transaction said. While the cash transaction took place the same day as the release of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and the other Americans, administration officials insist the payment did not constitute ransom and that there were was no quid pro quo for the payment. They said the agreement on the release of the prisoners dovetailed with the resolution of parallel negotiations over the dispute of the failed arms deal. ”It’s against the policy of the United States to pay ransom for hostages,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday. He described the payment as a ”conscious strategic decision that was made on the part of the Obama administration as we were implementing the deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon to resolve other longstanding concerns we had with Iran.” ”That included securing the release of five American citizens who had been unjustly detained in Iran, and closing out a longstanding financial dispute in a way that saved the American people potentially billions of dollars,” he said. In return for the US citizens’ release, the US dropped extradition requests for 14 Iranian citizens and freed seven. Former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran in 2007, remains missing.  Earnest cast those using the new details about the palettes of cash as people ”flailing to justify their continued opposition to the deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.”  The $400 million was Iran’s to start with, placed into a   trust fund to support American military equipment purchases in the 1970s. When the Shah was ousted by a 1979 popular uprising that led to the creation of the Islamic Republic, the US froze the trust fund. Iran has been fighting for a return of the funds through international courts since 1981.  In announcing the agreement, Obama said that paying the $400 million    plus $1. 3 billion in interest    was saving American taxpayers billions of dollars. The Iranians had been seeking more than $10 billion at arbitration. ”For the United States, this settlement saved us billions of dollars that could have been pursued by Iran,” Obama said in January. ”There was no benefit to the United States in dragging this out.” As it was making the January cash delivery, the US also imposed new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile testing. At the same time, the White House unfroze a larger pool of Iranian assets, estimated at $100 to $150 billion, as part of the nuclear deal, though administration officials cautioned that Iran would only pocket about $50 billion after legal claims.  Legal claims are one of the reasons the payment to Iran was controversial when Obama first announced it. The Clinton administration had agreed in 2000 to pay that $400 million to Americans who had won lawsuits against Iran in US courts.  These families and individuals had sued the Islamic Republic for damages after the deaths of loved ones or for being the victims themselves of   kidnappings or terrorist attacks. At the time, US officials told those families the money would come from Iran.  With Obama’s announcement, it became apparent that the payments had come from US taxpayers and not from Iran at all. Stuart Eizenstat, the Clinton administration’s deputy Treasury secretary, told Newsweek that Iran had filed a claim with The Hague, limiting the administration’s ability to lay claim to the fund.  Critics on Wednesday were further incensed by Iranian claims that the cash amounted to a ransom payment for the four prisoners. ”That sort of ransom payment as part of the Iran deal is an outrage,” said Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. US officials conceded that the Iranian negotiators involved in the prisoner exchange said they wanted the cash to coincide with the release of the Americans to prove a deliverable for the exchange even as they argued against the characterization of it as a ransom payment. ”As we’ve made clear, the negotiations over the settlement of an outstanding claim at The Hague Tribunal were completely separate from the discussions about returning our American citizens home,” State Department Spokesman John Kirby said, referring to the $1. 7 billion payout that the $400 cast installment was part of. ”Not only were (the) two negotiations separate, they were conducted by different teams on each side, including, in the case of the Hague claims, by technical experts involved in these negotiations for many years,” he said. ”The funds that were transferred to Iran were related solely to the settlement of a   claim at the   Claims Tribunal at The Hague.” ”It’s not surprising that Iran would want to call this a ransom for domestic political reasons,” another senior US official said. ”But that is not the case. The confidence built during the Iran nuclear negotiations helped the negotiations in other areas, so it is true all these things came together at the same time as implementation day of the Iran deal. But this was not a ransom.”"
2016-08-04,"While campaigning in Florida on Tuesday, Democratic   candidate Tim Kaine attacked congressional Republicans for failing to pass a funding bill that would have directed $1. 1 billion toward research to treat and prevent the Zika virus. According to the Orlando Sentinel: Kaine . . . called for federal action on fighting the Zika virus, which officials on Monday said had reached South Florida via mosquitoes. Kaine said Congress should pass a $1. 1 billion bill to combat Zika without what he called the “poison pill” of   language added by House Republicans. “Congress should not be in recess when Zika is advancing,” he said. In reality, it was Senate Democrats who refused to pass the bill, and there’s no “poison pill” to be found anywhere inside it. Instead, the Democratic leadership is balking because the bill does not specifically earmark a portion of funding for Planned Parenthood. While most of the funding outlined in the bill would go to mosquito prevention and vaccine research, a small segment is dedicated to   efforts. According to Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Democrats chose to block the entire bill because none of this small portion was earmarked for Planned Parenthood. RELATED: Florida’s Zika Season: One More Menace In an Electorate That’s Already in a Sour Mood, Senate Democratic leaders Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer held a press conference attempting to explain their decision shortly after leading an effort to kill the bill. Reid claimed that women would have nowhere to go to obtain birth control under the bill, but, in fact, nothing in the legislation would cut any federal funding currently going to Planned Parenthood. It simply does not add more funding in the context of treating Zika. Planned Parenthood’s executive director, Dawn Laguens, spoke alongside Reid and Schumer, implying that it is more important for Planned Parenthood to receive direct funding under the bill than it is to pass a bill quickly. A letter from Planned Parenthood to the Senate offices prior to the most recent vote stated that “a vote against this bill will be seen as a vote for women’s health care. ” But a vote against the bill is actually vote against women’s health care, particularly if the women in question have contracted the Zika virus. And, even from the perspective of Senate Democrats, there is no rational objection to the bill given that Planned Parenthood still would receive as much federal funding as it did before the Zika virus became an issue. But a compromise from Senate Democrats seems unlikely, given their latest statements. “We would love for them to end that filibuster and pass the bill, but it doesn’t sound like they’re prepared to do that,” Stewart tells National Review. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Meanwhile, Florida politicians have honed in with   focus on the question of research funding  —   the state this week reported 14 local Zika cases, all in the Miami neighborhood of Wynwood. These are the first cases originating from mosquito bites that occurred in the U. S. as opposed to cases related to international travel. Marco Rubio held a press conference Wednesday morning in Doral, Fla. emphasizing the need for immediate congressional action to pass a bill funding research and prevention. RELATED: Regulators’ Infectious Zika Incompetence, The Florida senator said he found it “inexcusable that Congress waited for months” to move on the issue and lamented that Zika has become “a political volleyball. ” Rubio said that Senate Democrats’ objections to the bill are not enough to justify voting against it. “There is absolutely nothing in the . . . bill that the House is insisting on that has anything to do with Planned Parenthood,” he explained. “I think to be, quite frank, they are making it up because they want a political issue. ” He also suggested that the White House has up to $300 million available to fund Zika research immediately, but that the administration might be withholding the money for political reasons.

S. senator from the state, has been pushing for the Senate to reconvene and pass an emergency spending bill. Complaining about the lack of response from McConnell, Nelson is said to have told a reporter, “Wait until a mosquito bites one of the people who is traveling to Kentucky and then he gets a transmitted case in Kentucky, then we’ll get action. ” Florida representative Patrick Murphy, a Democrat challenging Rubio for a seat in the U. S. Senate, has been using language similar to that of Kaine and Reid, claiming on his campaign website that “Republican leaders are proposing limiting access to contraception” and “prioritizing partisan attacks on women’s health. ” Senate Democrats likely will continue blaming Republicans’ opposition to “women’s health” for the political stalemate over   funding, but the real roadblock is Democrats’ absolute dedication to funding the abortion giant Planned Parenthood instead of actual women’s health care.,"
2016-08-05,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton invoked the “cone of friendship silence” when she was asked about the most meaningful conversation she’s had with a black friend. [The question was asked by ESPN’s Kevin Merida during Clinton’s appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists on Friday.  Clinton invoked the names of many of her African American women friends on her campaign, including one of her best friends in college, but did not answer the question. “Oh my gosh, well I could tell you that I am blessed to have a crew of great friends,” she said. Clinton said that her back friends had both chastised her in conversations and even “tried to expand my musical tastes. ” “I’m going to respect the cone of friendship silence, but please know I’ve got a lot of great friends who have given me so much more,” she said."
2016-08-06,"Dear M. C.: Seasonal adjustments make perfect sense. Without them, for instance, the job market would look like it collapses in the summer because teachers are temporarily let go from their jobs. And it would look like it’s booming in September, when they go back to work. Christmas would look like a hiring boom. January would look like a depression. The trouble with the models is when there is unusual economic activity, as has happened in recent years. If one spring, for instance, doesn’t have the normal spurt of hiring because business conditions are abnormally bad, then the next five years’ worth of seasonal adjustments can be thrown off. Why? Because if the following year turns out to be more normal, the government’s computers will make it look even better because they were comparing it on a seasonally adjusted basis to the spring that was abnormally bad. Seasonal adjustments look back five years, with each   year getting less significant in the calculations. So the abnormally bad spring still has an impact a   later. Because of the unusual behavior of the economy during the   Great Recession, the seasonal adjustments have been off. There is no reason for the Labor Department to use the   model, which guesses at how many jobs are being created by newly “born” companies that the government assumes aren’t being reached in its surveys. Each of these new companies  —   if they are legitimate  —   will file paperwork with Social Security and the IRS. The new workers from these new companies should be counted that way and the guesswork will be removed from the process. Dear F. G.: Glad to help. Dear S. H.: So let me get this straight: You like me, yet you want to condemn me to working for the government! Thanks a lot. And as far as my “personal relationship” with Trump, as I’ve said in other columns, I met Donald at the end of the 1980s when I worked at The New York Times, kept in touch professionally for a while and then lost touch. In other words, we just know each other. And the only paycheck I’ll ever get from the government is Social Security. Dear J. S.: Advice? I don’t have any. But I did have the phone number for  ’ top officials and your problem is now fixed  —   at least that’s what I was told. If this becomes   for some reason, get back to me and I will make another call. But I really do think this is fixed to your satisfaction. The only one who isn’t going to be happy is the person who has your old plate number and will now get billed for all their tolls. Happy motoring."
2016-08-07,"Two summers ago, when Nathan Tasker was 13, his mom drove him from Melrose, Mass. to Maine, where he would attend his first session at a transgender camp. Nathan remembers feeling happy for the first time in years. ”I finally, finally finally was not alone,” says Nathan, a young man with dark, sparkling eyes and a wise smile. But even at this camp, Nathan expected to be different. He’s transgender  —   and adopted. ”I thought I was just a packaged deal, like, this only happens to one kid in every place in the world,” he says. But then, as fellow campers told their stories, Nathan realized he was not all that different. ”I was like, ’You know what? There are a lot of adopted kids who are trans.’ And that’s pretty amazing.” Doctors at Boston Children’s Hospital’s Gender Management Service clinic, where Nathan is a patient, began making the same connection a few years ago. They combed through patient records and found that 8. 2 percent of the 184 young people seen in the clinic between 2007 and 2015 were raised in adoptive families. Overall, only 2. 3 percent of children living in Massachusetts were adopted. ”Before I started seeing transgender kids, it would not have occurred to me that we might see more adopted kids,” says Dr. Daniel Shumer, a pediatric endocrinologist who treated transgender kids at the GEMS clinic for three years before moving to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to work in a similar clinic. Shumer and three   recently presented their adoption data at a conference and have submitted it for publication. Nathan and his doctors aren’t the only members of the transgender community who’ve noticed this phenomenon. ”People have been talking about this for a long time,” says Dr. Johanna   medical director of the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles, the largest such clinic in the country.   says she often hears colleagues around the country say, ”we have a lot of kids who are adopted in the gender clinics.” And Diane Ehrensaft, a psychologist and author of the book, Gender Born, Gender Made: Raising Healthy   Children, says in an email, ”I am seeing the same thing in my work as a gender specialist in the San Francisco Bay Area.” Looking For Explanations, No one seems to know why. But there is some agreement about possible explanations. First, it may be that there’s a higher percentage of trans adopted children who get health care, rather than a higher rate of trans kids who are adopted. ”Adopted people of all ages, especially children, are disproportionately represented in clinical settings,” says Adam Pertman, president of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, and author of the book Adoption Nation. ”The majority of adoptions today are from foster care. Then add to those the children adopted from institutions abroad and you have a population who suffered early trauma  —   so of course they are disproportionately represented in clinical settings.” Shumer suggests another factor when it comes to families with adopted trans children: ”Perhaps parents who adopt kids are more open to differences in gender identity  —   may have less shame in the fact that their child may be transgender,” he says, ”[and] may be more likely to present to clinics for help.” That idea resonates with  ”When parents have biological children [who] are transgender,” she says, ”what happens is a blame game, like, ’Whose fault is it?’ I’ve heard many families say, ’Well, you know, my husband has two gay cousins’ or, ’My wife has a trans aunt.’ ”   says adoptive parents seem to ”let go of the ’this is my fault’ piece.” But maybe there’s something else about growing up adopted  —   about coming to terms with that experience  —   that explains why transgender clinics are seeing more such children. ”Adopted children who are aware of their adopted status also have an easier time being ’other’ than their parents, and therefore find greater ease in being forthcoming in expressing their true gender selves,” says Ehrensaft. Shumer says he wonders whether children who grow up knowing they are adopted might develop their identities in ways that make them more open to rethinking gender. ”As adoptive kids are becoming teenagers,” Shumer says, ”they may more actively consider their gender identity in the context of their overall identity [than kids who aren’t adopted]. This might help them identify that they have a gender difference more frequently than kids that aren’t adopted, that aren’t going through as rigorous an   thought process.” Pertman says that’s a new, but reasonable idea. ”Identity in adoption is a complex issue,” Pertman says. ”I mean it’s complex for everybody, but there’s a whole other layer for adopted people that sort of triggers, in many of them, a deeper look within themselves about identity. And maybe this is part of what they find.” More Theories  —   And The Need For More Study, Maybe, but that reasoning doesn’t ring true to Hunter Keith, a    trans male who was adopted at birth  —   at least not in terms of his own experience. Hunter says the gender transition he started in the eighth grade did not coincide with questions about his adoption. ”I’ve been part of my family my whole life,” Hunter says. ”I’ve never had that feeling of not belonging. It’s not something I ever questioned.” Hunter’s mother Roz, who lives with Hunter and her husband and daughter in the metropolitan Detroit area, would like to see more research about the neurological roots of gender identity. She believes there may be all kinds of connections that no one understands yet. Here’s one possibility Roz Keith has discussed with friends, based on studies that show greater rates of autism and learning disorders among transgender kids than among the general population: Could the kids be inheriting those conditions from their birth parents, and could those conditions be one reason the mothers place their children for adoption? ”There’s this incidence, then, of children who are adopted who have a genetic history coming from families where there are learning issues  —   ADD, ADHD,” Roz Keith suggests. ”It does seem that those things overlap and correspond in greater numbers [in the transgender population].” Some members of the transgender community say all these theories deserve more attention, but for now, they don’t see any connection between being trans and being adopted. ”I think it’s a stretch, frankly,” says Jamison Green, the immediate past president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. ”People, in trying to understand what ’transness’ is and how it manifests, and why some of us are this way, will elicit all kinds of conjectures.” Nonetheless, Green, who is adopted, says he would like to see more research in this area. The speculation ”speaks to how little we actually know,” Green says. ”There’s much more to be learned about transness, about gender, about gender identity development in all people.” With so little research, it’s not clear if or how these findings should affect care for children at transgender clinics. Shumer says it may help parents contemplating adoption to learn more about gender identity as a spectrum. Doctors, nurses and counselors may want to set up support groups for adopted children, to help kids who might find such groups useful explore any and all sorts of issues as they arise. Judy Tasker, Nathan’s mom, says she’s sure that being transgender and adopted makes life more complicated for her son. ”It’s the transgender piece that throws everyone off,” she says, ”but, really, it’s his issues from being in a poor foster home for the first 15 months of his life that really make him struggle at school, struggle with anger. The trans piece is this little piece, but it   what therapists see, what schools see, and they is fixate on it.” Nathan says he’s always assumed that being adopted and being trans were two separate experiences. But, ”maybe somehow they’re connected,” he says. ”Maybe adopted kids feel some dimensions that   kids can’t feel, because they haven’t been in that situation.” There are a lot of maybes in the expanding world of gender identity.

2016-08-08,"Rapper Troy Ave is suing Irving Plaza and its owners  —   claiming they should be held responsible for the    —   even though he was the one who was caught on video shooting up the place. The   rap artist, who’s been   alleges in his suit that the Union Square venue had lax security on the night of May 25, which ultimately allowed “a third party” to bring in the gun that claimed the life of Ronald McPhatter and left three others injured, including himself.  Surveillance footage from inside the Live Nation club shows Ave, whose real name is Ronald Collins, brandishing a pistol in the “Green Room” and blasting off multiple rounds at a target  . Speaking to reporters outside Irving Plaza on Monday afternoon, the    refused to say where he got the weapon or what went down that night. All he and his lawyers say is, security should have been more vigilant.  “The security did not pat down anyone who came in the back door. That’s the problem here,’’ explained the rapper’s lawyer, Scott Leemon. “People who came in through the VIP entrance in back were not checked by security. If you come in through the front door, everyone gets wanded and patted down. But people that come in the back were not. That’s how the gun was brought into this facility. ” But Leemon stopped short of disclosing where his client actually got the pistol, which was later found in the Collins’ van and linked to the bullet that killed McPhatter. “As we told you day 1, Troy did not bring a gun into this venue,” he seethed. “He is the victim here. He did not bring a gun into this place. And we are seeking redress for the negligence. ” Collins, on the   remained relatively   during the press conference as he limped around on crutches with his   bracelet around his right ankle.  “I’m going through a lot. I just want to get my life back,” he said.  In the civil complaint, filed Monday morning in Brooklyn Supreme Court, Leemon alleges that the murder weapon had been brought in by someone that Collins didn’t know.  “Any weapon recovered in the venue was brought into the venue by a third party who did not have any association with the plaintiff,” the complaint states. “Additionally, no one associated with the plaintiff  …    brought any weapon into the venue. ” At the time of the shooting, Collins claimed that he had wrestled the gun away from another man who was trying to “assassinate” him.  “Have you ever heard of  ? That’s what we’re talking about,” Leemon explained. “[Collins] was scared, OK? He did not shoot himself, he did not shoot his friend. He was a victim and that’s what he did. ” Authorities said the Crown Heights native had been   with a rap critic, who wrote a negative review about him, just before the bullets started flying. According to the complaint, when Collins walked into Irving Plaza, he was immediately “attacked by a third party,” who then brandished the gun and shot him twice in the leg during a struggle. “In addition, this third party shot and killed another individual that was with the plaintiff. .in the ‘Green Room,’” the complaint says. “As a result of this incident, the plaintiff, a 30 year old promising performer with his entire career ahead of him, has been left with disabling injuries which will forever affect his life, his career and his pursuits. ” Leemon claimed the footage showing Collins firing the pistol should was ultimately tangential. “We are talking about what happened before that, OK? Before that,” he said. “[Collins] did not bring that gun into the venue. That’s the important thing. That gun was brought into the venue by somebody else, and because of that my client was shot. ”  In the suit, Leemon goes on to say that the entire incident was “wholly preventable”  —   if not for the “clear negligence and carelessness of the defendants in their promotion, direction, production, supervision and control” of operations that night. He also claims that Irving Plaza and Live Nation should have been fully aware of the dangers of holding a T. I. concert, following the slew of famous shooting incidents that have gone down with rappers in the past  —   including Tupac Shakur, Sean Diddy Combs, Notorious BIG and Jam Master Jay. Collins is currently free on $500, 000 bail after being charged with attempted murder. He is forced to wear the electronic monitoring bracelet around his ankle and is barred from leaving the city as a condition of his release. No one else has been charged in connection to the incident.

2016-08-09,"I am not what most people think of when they imagine a Hispanic immigrant. I am paler than most   Americans, I live in a leafy suburb, and my English is better than my Spanish. There’s also the small detail that I do not remember my own immigration.   I came to the US shortly after my first birthday, on an American Airlines flight from El Dorado airport in Bogotá, Colombia, to Dulles international airport in the suburbs of Washington DC, in 1999. My parents were both professionals with graduate degrees. My father was moving from a job in a management consultancy in Bogotá to one near Washington. I had been born in Bogotá to a Colombian mother, from the Caribbean city of Barranquilla, and a Colombian American father whose early life acted as a mirror to mine. While I was born in Bogotá and raised in Washington DC, he was born in Washington DC and raised in Bogotá.   My grandparents were part of the politically active professional class of Colombia, and both my parents went to university in the US. Before I was born, they had lived in Paris for three years before moving back to Colombia for my father’s job. It was there that I was born.   Colombia at the time was not the Colombia of today. It was not a country to which you would see package vacations advertised in the New York Times. Violence due to drug cartels, fascist paramilitaries and communist guerrillas was still rife. My parents must have known that, but they had been away from the country for a while. My father thought that a normal life in Colombia, as they had lived in Paris, was possible. But when my mother heard that blue corneas had a market value, she decided that Colombia was not the place to raise her   son. It was at her insistence that my parents moved, with me, to Washington.   Of course, I don’t remember any of that. In all my memories I have lived in Bethesda, Maryland. I never experienced the struggle of learning a new language or fitting into a new culture. My mother became a US citizen in 2004 in order to vote for John Kerry, and apart from occasional trips to visit relatives in Colombia, we were as American a family as any of our white, mainly Wasp neighbors.   It was only in high school that I fully understood what it meant when I said that I was from Colombia. Before then, those who asked me tended to be my peers, who had no   notions of what a Colombian should be, or adults who knew my parents. But adolescence awakens adulthood, and it was in high school that I became conscious that I was an immigrant. People began to say: “You don’t look Colombian” or “You don’t look Hispanic. ” They did not mean any harm, and didn’t cause any either.   It was also in high school that I met immigrants who remembered their home countries. People from Colombia who spoke with accents utterly distinct to my bland   English, who could roll their Rs, and who knew the neighborhoods of the city where I had always said I was from.  Most of my friendship group did not include these newcomers. I had friends from middle school, and as high school progressed I stayed in the same, mainly white, milieu. I took SAT prep courses, fencing, advanced classes  —   in short, everything you would expect from a teen from upper   American suburbia who is aiming for the Ivies. Not that I have no Hispanic friends I do. They just tend to be as highly assimilated as I am.   I am an immigrant. But in all honesty, I do not know what it is like to leave the country you have known all your life, because the country I remember from my earliest days is the one I live in. But I was born abroad, and that geographical accident builds a silent and invisible wall between me and my purely   friends. "
2016-08-10,"         It was not yet dawnÂ whenÂ the armored vehicles, black and hulking like Batmobiles, rumbled into theÂ residential neighborhood in Compton, Calif. A carjacker had stolen a vehicleÂ in Los Angeles, exchanged gunfire with sheriff s deputies and then ditched his prize, disappearing on foot into a dense patchwork quilt of pink houses. The armored vehicles  ”Â and the heavily armed deputies insideÂ them  ”Â were there to find andÂ capture the armed carjacker. Instead, they found a different black man, Donnell Thompson. As the carjacker hid in a house several blocks away, Thompson sleptÂ in a stranger s yard. Â He was 27 years old but possessedÂ the mental faculties of a much younger man. HeÂ loved Uno, Michael Jackson and the Lakers. He was so gentle and shy he went by the nickname Little Bo Peep, his family told the Los Angeles Times. He had a clean record and was unarmed. FromÂ insideÂ one of the armored vehicles, however, Â Los Angeles County Sheriff s deputies knew none of this. When Thompson didn t respond to commands, the deputies detonated  . When he still didn t move, they hitÂ him with foamÂ bullets. And when he allegedly ranÂ toward them, a deputy atop the armored vehicle opened fire with an assault rifle, Â striking Thompson twice in the torso. Thompson died. At almost the same instant, the real carjacker was arrested. That was July 28. ForÂ almost two weeks, the Sheriff s Department insisted that Thompson was a second suspect in the carjacking. On Tuesday, the department admitted it had killed an innocent man.  No question this is a terribly devastating event, ? Capt. Steve Katz said during a newsÂ conference. Â He said there wasÂ  no physical evidence ? connecting Thompson to the carjacking or shootout and promised a  thorough ? and  complete ? investigation into the shooting, according to the Associated Press. Thompson s relatives said they wanted more than an investigation, however. They wanted charges for the deputy who killed Thompson.  I wouldn t treat an animal this bad, ? his sister Matrice Stanley told the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, according to the AP.  How is this justifiable? ?    Matrice Stanley, center, sister of Donnell Thompson, speaks to reporters about her brother s death outside Los Angeles County HallÂ onÂ Tuesday (Nick  )  TheÂ incident is the latest in a string of fatal   shootings of black men across America. As in the recent police killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. the shooting in Compton has prompted accusations of racial profiling and excessive force. Stanley said she thought her brother s race played a role in the shooting. The incidentÂ also raises questions about the militarization of law enforcement, as departments across the country increasingly useÂ armored vehicles and assault rifles to fight crime.  In a civilian neighborhood, they bring an urban assault vehicle, ? Brian Dunn, an attorney representing the Thompson family, told the Huffington Post.  The BearCat, it s like a tank. Their response to this situation was so aggressive. Their tactics were so aggressive. ? The tragedy began in the early hours of July 28 when Robert Alexander, 24, allegedly stole a Honda Civic in Los Angeles, taking the car at gunpointÂ from its owner. Fifteen miles to the south, in Compton, a sheriff s deputy later spotted the Civic traveling erratically and decided to pull it over, according to the Los Angeles Times. The license plate showed the car was stolen. As a second patrol car arrived, the Civic drove off, punching through an elementary school s fence. As the car sped through Compton, Alexander allegedly shot at deputies, causing them to return fire. After the Civic crashed into a parked car, Alexander escaped on foot. As he ran along Slater Street, the carjacker threatened two people on a front porch, according to the Times. He then entered the house, threw his gun under a couch, took his clothes off and climbed into a bed where an elderly woman  ”Â a complete stranger  ”Â was sleeping. Despite the ruse, deputies found him and arrested him at 4:59 a. m. Seconds later, a man living a few blocks away called 911. He told dispatchers he was taking out his trash when he spotted a figure lying in his front yard, the Times reported. Although authorities already had Alexander in custody, there was confusion over whether he was the carjacker. A deputy who responded to the 911 call, meanwhile, saw that the figure in the man sÂ front yard resembled the carjacking suspect: a black man between the ages of 20 and 30 wearing dark pants or shorts and a basketball jersey. The deputy radioed that he had found the carjacker who had fired at police, and theÂ armored vehicles quickly arrived.    Matrice Stanley, at left in black, and familyÂ members appear before Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday to protest Donnell Thompson s fatal shootingÂ byÂ a sheriff s deputy. (Nick  )  Thompson didn t respond to commands, instead remaining motionless with one hand under his head and another concealed near his waist. Â An object that looked like a gun lay nearby, Katz said. When   explosives failed to wake Thompson, SWAT deputies shot him withÂ foam bullets. At that point, Thompson suddenly pushed himself to his feetÂ and ranÂ toward an armored vehicle, Katz said. An officer in the vehicle s turret shot Thompson twice in the upper torso with an M4 assault rifle, the Times reported. Stanley, Thompson s sister, Â said sheÂ thought her brother didn t respond to commandsÂ because he was afraid and confused, Â the AP reported. She called for the deputy to be fired, Â questioningÂ whyÂ he opened fire when he was protected by the armored car. Dunn, the family attorney, Â accused the Sheriff s Department of a series of  tactical blunders ? and called the shooting a  mistake. ?  We ve done our own investigation and have not heard anything to suggest that Donnell Thompson was in any way acting in an aggressive manner or in any way demonstrating that he posed a threat to anyone, ? Dunn told the Huffington Post. Dunn also claimed:  He hadn t committed a crime, he was not wanted, he had not done anything wrong, he was legally authorized to be where he was, he was legally authorized to be doing what he was doing, he wasn t breaking the law and he wasn t armed  • when you take that backdrop of facts it s just not only a tragedy, but it s a homicide, in every sense of the word. ? The attorney said he had filed a federal civil rights claim against Los Angeles County and was preparing to file a lawsuit as well. Experts cautioned, however, that just because the Sheriff s Department had admitted Thompson was innocent doesn t mean the shooting will be declared unjustified.  The commands being ignored, they used   force that was ineffective, the guy was running away.  ¦ Those factors are very relevant in leading them to believe,  This guy has done something wrong. This is our guy,  ? Ed Obayashi, a Plumas County sheriff s deputy and attorney who advisesÂ several law enforcement agencies in the state, told the Times. Adding to concerns over the incident, however, are two other shootings of unarmed men by the same department in the past two weeks. A homeless man was shotÂ on Aug. 2 while running from deputies. And a man caught tagging a houseÂ with graffiti was shot while hidingÂ in a shower. Those shootings are also under investigation, the Times reported. But it is the death of Thompson that has stirred anger and spurred protests.

2016-08-11,"In November,    congressional candidate Justin Fareed will have the opportunity to end Democrats’   domination of the constantly changing districts across California’s central coast. “I’m very optimistic that the electorate is looking for a new generation of leadership,” Fareed tells National Review. “What we are seeing today is Congress circumventing the big issues we face. ” “This seat was very much on the radar of the national parties. . . . This has been about politics for the Democrats,” Fareed says, arguing that they want to retain the seat without articulating a “vision for the central coast. ” Fareed played football at UCLA, worked as a legislative aide for Representative Ed Whitfield, and is now the vice president of his family’s business, Pro Band Sports Industries. While working alongside Whitfield, he focused on U. S. —  Turkish relations, leading a congressional staff delegation to Turkey. He hopes to use that Middle East policy experience if elected in order to fix the mess created by the Obama administration, which he argues, “very well may be the worst administration as foreign policy goes in our nation’s history. ” Getting the “right” people into Congress has always been difficult, of course. The huge advantages of incumbency continue to ensure that there is minimal turnover from Congress to Congress. Last cycle, 96 percent of sitting representatives and senators were reelected. Fareed would like to change that. “Many of my opponents spent decades running for one office and then the next,” he says with exasperation. “In my humble opinion, I don’t believe that this was meant to be a career job. ” More Congress The Medicaid Spending Caps Are More Complex Than They Seem423 to 4The Left Espouses Dangerously Stupid   RhetoricAnd yet, in order to change the system, Fareed will need help from many of the same career politicians who embody it. He has compiled a long list of   endorsements, from Speaker Paul Ryan to House majority leader Kevin McCarthy to Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. He is one of eleven Republican candidates nationally receiving help from the Young Guns program, which was founded by Ryan, McCarthy, and former House majority leader Eric Cantor to help elect   Republicans to Congress. Since 2010, the program has helped elect more than 100 favored candidates for House seats. Fareed is hoping to become another, and to bring “  values with a   vision” to Capitol Hill.,"

2016-08-13,"Eighty years ago this month, the United States competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games in Nazi Germany, with 18   athletes part of the U. S. squad. Track star Jesse Owens, one of the greatest Olympians of all time, won four gold medals. What the 17 other   Olympians did in Berlin, though, has largely been forgotten  —   and so too has their rough return home to racial segregation. ”Determination! That’s what it takes,” one of the athletes, John Woodruff, said during a 1996 oral history interview for the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. ”A lot of fire in the stomach!” Woodruff won the gold medal in the   race  —   and he did it in Adolf Hitler’s Germany. ”There was very definitely a special feeling in winning the gold medal and being a black man,” Woodruff said. ”We destroyed his   theory whenever we [started] winning those gold medals.” Cornelius Johnson won the top spot on the medal stand in the high jump. Dave Albritton won silver. Another medalist was one of Jackie Robinson’s older brothers, Mack, who won silver in the   dash. Future U. S. Rep. Ralph Metcalfe brought home two medals of his own  —   a silver in the 100 meters and a gold in the   relay. In all, the 18   including Owens, won 14 medals  —   eight of them gold. That was a quarter of the 56 medals won by the entire U. S. team. Unlike Woodruff and the other   medalists, though, two Jewish athletes on the U. S. team did not get a shot at winning any medals. Runners Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller were benched at the last minute and replaced with Owens and Metcalfe in the men’s   relay. A similar move took place in 1932, when Tidye Pickett and Louise Stokes became the first black women to qualify for the U. S. team but were later replaced with white runners. Pickett and Stokes were eager to finally compete four years later in Berlin. Pickett did run in the hurdles, but she broke her foot during a semifinal race. Stokes was replaced again with a white teammate. ”I think [Stokes] could’ve been the first black woman to bring home a gold medal for America,” says Deborah Riley Draper, who wrote, directed and produced a new documentary called Olympic Pride, American Prejudice. The film includes another story of disappointment:   boxer Howell King, who was sent home from Berlin by the U. S. boxing team manager. Supposedly, the decision was because of ”homesickness,” but Draper says King suspected the manager wanted to replace him with a white boxer. ”Howell King himself said, ’I didn’t quit! I took a   boat to Berlin. Why would I quit and want to go all the way back to Detroit?’ ” Draper says. All of the   athletes at the 1936 Olympics should be remembered, Draper says, not just Owens. ”It was easier to tell the story of one   because that’s an anomaly,” Draper says. ”But 18, that’s a lot for Jim Crow newspapers to want to report on.” The 18 were called ”The Black Eagles” by The Pittsburgh Courier, an influential   newspaper. In Berlin, they lived in the racially integrated Olympic Village, which was a high point many would never experience again. ”They were Olympic athletes when they were on the medal stand,” Draper says. ”When they came back home to a segregated America, they came back to being Negroes.” Some entered academia. Others held elected office. Many struggled to establish stable careers, including Robinson, the silver medalist. He once used his Olympic jacket to keep warm while working as a street sweeper. Still, according to University of Mississippi historian Charles Ross, all the athletes represented a generation of pioneers who chiseled away at stereotypes. ”You have to have Jesse Owens and the other 17   before you can have John Carlos, [Muhammad] Ali, George Foreman,” Ross says. Ross says the 18   Olympians of 1936 understood that their dreams had to be limited. None of them were invited to the White House, or shook the hand of President Franklin Roosevelt. Months after Owens returned home, he told a crowd, ”The president didn’t even send me a telegram.”"
2016-08-14,"Authorities say a police officer in a small, central Georgia city has been shot and killed by a suspect who remains on the loose. Special agent Scott Whitley of the Georgia bureau of investigation told the Associated Press that Eastman patrol officer Tim Smith, 31, was fatally shot at about 9. 30pm Saturday in a residential area of the city about 60 miles   of Macon.  “Officer Smith exited his patrol car to investigate and was shot by the individual,” the Georgia bureau of investigation said in a statement.  Whitley said Smith was responding to a suspicious person call when he encountered the suspect, exited his patrol car and was shot. The suspect fled the scene.  Whitley said Smith was in his early 30s but no further information about him was immediately available. He said an unidentified suspect was being sought and an investigation was ongoing.  Smith was not wearing a body camera. The Georgia bureau of investigation is seeking tips to identify and find the assailant, it said. It did not release information about a possible motive for the attack. "
2016-08-15,"Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin activated the Wisconsin National Guard on Sunday to assist local law enforcement following a night of violence in Milwaukee that began hours after a police officer fatally shot a fleeing armed man there. Angry crowds confronted the police in Milwaukee on Saturday night, setting fires and throwing rocks following the shooting that afternoon. One fire, at a gas station in the Sherman Park neighborhood, burned unattended while gunshots kept firefighters from extinguishing it. Other fires burned at an   store, a beauty supply company and a bank branch. One police officer was hospitalized with a head injury after a brick was thrown through the window of his patrol car, Mayor Tom Barrett said at a news conference early Sunday morning. The police reported just before 3:30 a. m. that order was being restored to the area. In a statement, Governor Walker praised volunteer   efforts on Sunday morning. “This act of selfless caring sets a powerful example for Milwaukee’s youth and the entire community,” he said. “I join Milwaukee’s leaders and citizens in calling for continued peace and prayer. ” Mr. Walker noted that, under Wisconsin law, the shooting was being examined by an independent investigation and asked that people give law enforcement “the respect they deserve for working so hard to keep us safe. ” Mr. Walker said he decided to make the National Guard available to provide assistance upon request after consulting with the mayor of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee County sheriff. Three people were arrested on unspecified charges during the mayhem, in which crowds of at least 200 people filled the streets, said Assistant Chief James Harpole of the Milwaukee police. The shooting and protests come as communities across the nation scrutinize what many see as excessive use of force by law enforcement officers, particularly against black people. Protests broke out across the country last year after a police officer in Madison, Wis. fatally shot an unarmed biracial man. The race and identity of the officer and the man shot and killed on Saturday were not immediately released. Many of the protesters were black, and Alderman Khalif J. Rainey expressed the frustration within the community. “The black people of Milwaukee are tired,” he said. “They’re tired of living under this oppression. “What has happened may not have been right,” Mr. Rainey said, “I’m not justifying that, but nobody can deny that there are racial problems here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that have to be rectified, because if you don’t, you’re one day away. ” The Saturday shooting came after more violence in Milwaukee. Five people were shot and killed overnight Friday, Mr. Barrett said at a news conference recorded by The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel earlier on Saturday. At least two of those occurred near where the officer shot the man on Saturday. The violence overnight Saturday erupted after an officer killed a man who the police said was armed with a semiautomatic handgun and who fled after a traffic stop. The police said two uniformed officers stopped two people in a car at about 3:30 p. m. on Saturday. The police did not provide details on why the car was stopped, though Mr. Barrett said the episode began when police spotted a “suspicious vehicle. ” Both occupants ran from the car. During the pursuit, Mr. Barrett said, an officer ordered the man to drop his gun and fired when he did not, striking the man in the chest and an arm. He said the gun held 23 rounds. The man, described by the police as a    Milwaukee man with a lengthy arrest record, died at the scene. The handgun had been taken in a burglary in March, the police said. The officer was not named, but officials said he was 24 and had been an officer for three years. He was placed on administrative duty. Mr. Barrett appealed to parents to keep their children off the streets in order to restore calm in the neighborhood. “Parents, get your kids home,” he said at the news conference. Mr. Barrett said that the officer was wearing a body camera that he understood to be operating and that the investigation into the shooting would be conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Justice because the case involved a Milwaukee police officer."
2016-08-16,"   Steven Pearlstein is a business and economics writer at The Post and a public affairs professor at George Mason University.       My colleague David Ignatius is right [“When robots take all the jobs,” Washington Forum, Aug. 12] that millions of jobs are threatened by things such as   cars, voice recognition systems and intelligent software, in the same way that millions of jobs were eliminated by the mechanical reaper and precision lasers and computers. The result will certainly be a lot of economic churn and dislocation. And as with similar job losses from globalization, if we don’t find a mechanism for the winners of this process to provide a better economic safety net for the losers, there will be a populist backlash. However, there are many who, like Ignatius, worry that this next wave of technology progress may be different  —   that, in the end, there won’t be enough work for everyone to earn a living and have productive lives. These skeptics have a difficult time imagining what all those displaced cabdrivers and bookkeepers will do. But historical experience strongly suggests that there will be jobs for those who want them at wages in line with those in the rest of the economy.  So how would that work? Remember, first, that these technological advances will be adopted because companies will be able to make and do things cheaper. Because of this, people will buy more of what they are selling, generating an increase in demand for those newly productive workers that will at least partly offset the initial job loss from automation. A generation ago, for example, air travel was so expensive that only wealthy people could afford to fly. Improvements in airplane technology and computer reservation systems have changed that, and now millions more Americans fly for business or pleasure or simply to go home for the holidays. There are fewer employees per flight, but more planes, pilots and flight attendants than ever.  Not all the benefit from increased productivity is captured by consumers in the form of lower prices, however. Some is captured by the workers who remain, who can now command higher wages because of the extra skills they have acquired. The rest of the benefit goes to company shareholders in the form of increased profit. And let’s not forget all those new   jobs associated with designing, manufacturing and marketing all that   technology. With their higher incomes, all of these people  —   the remaining workers, shareholders and technology producers  —   will buy more goods and services of all sorts, increasing the demand for the workers who produce them. I realize such   economics has gotten a bad name in some circles, but there is some truth in it. The winners from   technology hire more gardeners, housekeepers and   workers. They take more vacations and eat at more restaurants. They buy more cars and boats and bigger houses. They engage the services of more auto mechanics and personal trainers, psychologists and orthopedic surgeons. To be sure, some of those are   jobs. But in a country whose   labor force is likely to shrink because of lower birth rates, an aging population and a trend toward earlier retirements, even these workers’ standard of living will rise. In the same way that barbers in the United States make many times more than equally productive barbers in India, the only way companies will be able to meet the increased demand for auto mechanics and personal trainers is to pay them enough to keep them from choosing some other line of work. In case you hadn’t noticed, yoga instructors in big cities can now make upward of $30 an hour. That’s not far from what those lost manufacturing jobs paid. In a   service economy, they are the new working class. These adjustments can take years, even decades, because there is so much “friction” in labor markets. People who lose their jobs must have the willingness and wherewithal to find new opportunities, learn new skills, move to new cities  —   and to the degree they do not, the economy’s ability to keep everyone employed will be frustrated.     One of Ford Motor Company’s original factories in Dearborn, Mich. still produces the   truck. The assembly line remains, but the process has come a long way. (Jayne   Washington Post)   Technology skeptics will argue that a bookkeeper displaced by intelligent software isn’t likely to become a software engineer. Fair enough  —   but that’s not the way you would expect labor markets to adjust. The way it might work is the bookkeeper upgrades her skills to become an accountant, an accountant becomes an actuary, an actuary becomes a math professor, and a math professor becomes a software engineer who creates even better bookkeeping software. In a market economy, nobody plans or manages this   process  —   it is the natural dynamic by which market economies become richer as productivity improves. Improvements in agricultural productivity led to a wave of migration of farmworkers to the cities, where they provided the manpower for an industrial economy that eventually become so productive that we could afford to buy more health care, education and, yes, government. Now we are on the cusp of another wave of “creative destruction. ” The fact that nobody can say where exactly the new jobs will come from is not unusual, nor is it reason to despair.

2016-08-18,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, In the aftermath of the news that the young woman who accused the Birth of a Nation director Nate Parker of rape is dead, much of the resulting coverage has centered on the case itself and the possible impact on the film’s release this fall. But the incident, which took place when they were students at Pennsylvania State University in 1999, also brings to the fore questions about how much schools have —  and have not —  done in the intervening years to adequately address campus sexual assault and the actions they would be required to take had this happened in 2016. The answer, according to Carol Tracy, the executive director of the Women’s Law Project and an attorney for the woman: not enough. ”I have no reason to think some of what she experienced, other students are not also experiencing these days.” Tracy told The Atlantic.  The basics of the case are this: Parker, who has soared to prominence in recent months as a result of the   film —  centered around the Nat Turner slave rebellion —  and his classmate Jean Celestin, who is credited on the film, were both accused of sexually assaulting a fellow Pennsylvania State University student. The men, who were on the school’s wrestling team at the time, were arrested and tried after the young woman reported the incident to local police. Parker was acquitted, in part because it was revealed that he and the young woman had previously had consensual sexual relations. Celestin was convicted, but that conviction was later appealed.  The fact that the case was reported and that it went to trial at all is rare, noted John Foubert, the president of One in Four, a nonprofit dedicated to ending rape. Most   cases are handled by schools themselves. A 2007 study suggested that only about 12 percent of student victims reported the incidents to law enforcement. Only a fraction of those reports resulted in charges, and even fewer went to trial. The rate of reporting was even lower back in 2000, around the time the alleged victim accused Parker of assault, Foubert said. “I don’t think the courts have gotten any less horrific,” he said, when asked whether the case might have been handled differently had it come to light today.  Even if the courts had handled the case differently —  placing less emphasis on what the woman was wearing, for instance, or that she was intoxicated, or acknowledging that even though she’d had consensual sex with Parker previously, rape was possible —  victim advocates think the school also could and should have done more to address the situation. “They were under an obligation to respond,” Tracy said.  The young woman ultimately filed a suit against the school alleging that it failed to do enough to protect her after the allegations were brought against Parker and Celestin. The young men allegedly harassed the young woman after she reported the purported assault, and she withdrew from the school for a time. The young woman’s suit against Penn State contended that the school had responded with “deliberate indifference to known, severe, and pervasive sexual harassment that effectively denied” her equal access to education, a violation of Title IX, the federal law that prohibits   discrimination in education. The young woman eventually reached a settlement of $17, 500 with Penn State. She reportedly committed suicide in the spring of 2012 at age 30, after several previous suicide attempts in the months following the alleged assault.  “She was not interested in money,” Tracy said, emphasizing the not. “Her goal was to make sure that what happened to her didn’t happen to other women. ” (Tracy declined to speak specifically about the young woman, who, she said, “wanted to be anonymous,” but said it was “a tragedy of immense proportions for her family. ”)  In the nearly two decades following the alleged assault, and particularly in the past several years, Tracy said, there “has been an enormous shift in culture and a shift in practice. ” Young women on campuses across the country have staged protests demanding that schools do more to prevent campus sexual assault, to respond when it happens, and to help those involved feel safe. In response to a phone call requesting comment, Penn State emailed a   statement saying it was “committed to the safety and security” of students, and did not respond to a   email request for more information. In its email, the school also included a link to a news release noting the university’s president in 2015 accepted a series of recommendations by a task force put together to examine the school’s response to sexual assault. The recommendations included implementing mandatory training —  including on bystander intervention —  for faculty and staff, the administration of an annual climate survey, and a required course for students, among other things.  Kristen Houser of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, based in Pennsylvania, said she thinks the university is now “in a different place,” and has made an effort to take steps to improve its response to such situations by reaching out to organizations like hers, and she said she’s encouraged by the fact that the most recent climate survey suggests students have confidence in the university’s ability to respond. “I do think we’re seeing schools realize   …     that this is something they really do need to take seriously,” Houser said. But she added that she thinks campus sexual assault remains a “pervasive, common, and serious problem” at colleges across the country. Studies vary, but roughly 20 percent of undergraduate women nationally say they have experienced sexual assault or attempted sexual assault. Schools need to “reinforce healthy and respectful interactions,” Houser said. “That’s how you prevent sexual assault. ”  When asked whether she thinks the school would have responded differently to the Parker case had the incident happened today, Tracy said that “given the scrutiny of their behavior   …     I should certainly hope so. ”  While myriad schools have been hit in the past several years with allegations of mishandling sexual assault, Penn State in particular has repeatedly faced accusations that it brushed sexual misconduct allegations aside to protect people tied to its athletics programs. Most well known is the 2012 case involving Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach convicted of 45 charges of abusing boys at the university and other locations. (Sandusky, who is serving his sentence at a prison in Pennsylvania, continues to deny that he is guilty.)  The Obama administration has claimed to make campus sexual assault a priority, with Vice President Joe Biden largely leading the effort, and recent student movements accusing schools of   and placing undue emphasis on whether students have been drinking have erupted on campuses across the country. “Sex without consent is rape,” Biden said earlier this year. “It is   rape. And if you cannot consent because you are unconscious, it is rape. It is rape. Period. ” “If you don’t have the courage to walk up and say, ‘Hey, Jack, not in my house,’ you are an accomplice. You are an accomplice,” he said.  The young woman involved in the Parker case said that she was intoxicated and unconscious at the time of the alleged rape, and alleged that she received little support from the university. At the time, there was less public and institutional support for accusers, largely women, particularly where they had been drinking. “Every stereotype that one has about sexual assault was introduced at that trial,” Tracy said, noting that what her client was wearing came up in the trial. The young woman alleged that the university, which said at the time of the incident that it would suspend accused students if there was a direct threat to the accuser, didn’t take steps to help her. The school, she said in the suit, changed her housing, eventually relocating her   but did not restrict Parker or Celestin’s movements, and refused to address what she alleged were continued taunts and threats from the pair and their friends.  “She was tormented,” S. Daniel Carter, a campus   advocate for a nonprofit at the time of the alleged assault, told The Hollywood Reporter. ”It was the constant contact and fear of seeing her assailants on campus. This was long before any real guidance on sexual assault came out. ” Beyond a public campaign to press colleges to rethink how they approach campus sexual assault, the U. S. Education Department in 2011 issued guidance to schools that lowered the standard of proof in such cases to a “preponderance of the evidence,” meaning the cases need more evidence suggesting that an offense was committed than not. Previously, schools often required “clear and convincing evidence” to deem a student guilty. And federal regulations that went into effect last year require schools to offer “primary prevention and awareness programs” to students aimed at reducing sexual assault on campus. The classes cover what does and does not constitute consent, and make clear that bystanders who might witness an assault have a responsibility to intervene.  “I think by today’s legal standards, a lot has changed with regards to universities and the laws in sexual assault,” the young woman’s brother told Variety. “I feel certain if this were to happen in 2016, the outcome would be different than it was. Courts are a lot stricter about this kind of thing. You don’t touch someone who is so intoxicated —  period. ” “I must admit Penn State has a horrendous record,” he added. “And Jerry Sandusky is just the tip of the iceberg. The University has a history of protecting [athletes]. ”  While some universities have heeded calls to do more to protect victims (California passed a “yes means yes” law whose proponents said took the burden of “no means no” off the victims, for example) others have pushed back. Oklahoma Wesleyan University recently joined a lawsuit questioning the administration’s guidance. The suit, brought by a University of Virginia student, says that the administration’s guidance steps on the   rights of the accused. The student was found responsible for sexual misconduct, but officials said that likely would not have been the case if the school had continued using the “clear and convincing” framework. And Harvard Law School professors penned a statement against the Ivy League school’s updated campus   policies, which they argue lacks due process for the accused, among other things.  Parker, who has maintained his innocence, wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday night, “I myself just learned that the young woman ended her own life several years ago and I am filled with profound sorrow  …    I can’t tell you how hard it is to hear this news. I can’t help but think of all the implications this has for her family. ”  “I look back on that time, my indignant attitude and my heartfelt mission to prove my innocence with eyes that are more wise with time,” he added. “I see now that I may not have shown enough empathy even as I fought to clear my name. Empathy for the young woman and empathy for the seriousness of the situation I put myself and others in. ”  The case has now become part of a larger, complicated picture of a man who has widely been credited with furthering an important conversation about the lack of diversity in the entertainment world, but who those close to the accuser say ultimately derailed a young woman’s life. Parker is reportedly set to embark on a roadshow that would have him visiting college campuses to discuss social justice and other issues, and movie executives are reportedly reevaluating whether that makes sense in light of recent news.  Houser hopes the case will serve as a reminder that people who are accused of sex crimes are not easily put into a box they don’t all act and look the same. “They have skills, they’re talented, they have friends and family, they vote, they shovel other people’s walks   …     People want to say sex offenders are all bad and they’re not. People can do really good things and really bad things and that’s just life,” she said. But Houser also said she hopes the case is a reminder of how infrequently people make false allegations about sexual assault. Just because someone is an athlete or doesn’t fit a certain expectation for what a person capable of such a crime looks like, doesn’t mean he or she isn’t capable of committing assault.  Tracy was reluctant to comment on Parker and his film, wearily saying that she could not possibly be unbiased. For her, the drudging up of the case is a chance to remind people that “the depth of bias against rape victims continues. ” Many of the allegations of assault she’s heard in the last four or five years, she said, “resemble in great detail” the allegations her client made all those years ago. “I think,” she said, “a lot of the problems continue to exist. ”  Hayley Glatter contributed reporting."
2016-08-19,"Twitter has told us that in the last six months, it has suspended 235, 000   accounts. So they’ve been taking Breitbart Tech’s advice then. Good! [It certainly took them long enough. For almost a year now, we’ve been pointing out that Twitter seems to prioritize the feelings of feminists over tackling terrorists and their supporters, who use the platform to spread propaganda and attract impressionable young recruits.  In late 2014, when ISIS was ramping up its activities on the social network, Twitter appointed the feminist group Women, Action, and Media as a partner to recommend accounts to suspend. At a crucial moment in the rise of ISIS, Twitter chose to work with a group that monitored mean comments on the internet, as opposed to, say, the Brookings Institution, which tracks support for ISIS on the social network. It was the Brookings Institution, by the way, that discovered between 46, 000 and 90, 000 active ISIS accounts on Twitter in March 2015. This was the same year Twitter started experimenting with “quality filters” to protect the platform’s   celebrities from hurt feelings. We also weren’t the only ones to notice that Twitter has yet to take any action against the   preacher Anjem Choudary, despite repeated requests from British authorities to take down his posts. Choudary is likely to be jailed in the U. K. for promoting terror before he’s banned on Twitter. As Twitter’s nemesis, I’ve made it my mission to point out their warped standards at every possible opportunity.  They’re clearly nervous  —   perhaps because I’m not going to let them wriggle out of my data access request, which they attempted to slither away from last week. Now that they’re on the run, they have to show they’ve been using their   book of rules to protect more people than just feminists and whiny celebrities. It won’t help their biased image one iota. We already know that they fail to take down death threats against conservatives, that they protect celebrities who engage in vile racist abuse, and they allow shocking incitement to violence against the police to remain on the platform, so long as it comes from the right people  —   i. e, Black Lives Matter. Perhaps it’s all part of Twitter’s plan  —   after all, they’re happy to accept feminists’ definition of “harassment,” which is “anyone who disagrees with me. ” Perhaps they’re getting ready to endorse a new definition of “extremism” too  —   one that includes all of my fans!

2016-08-20,"  Sorry Usain Bolt, but if ever a competitor was guaranteed Olympic success before competition began, this was surely it. The day after Jamaica’s sprint superstar completed his historic ” ” of medals, the US women’s basketball team claimed yet another gold at Rio 2016 Saturday as it trounced Spain by   Remarkably, it was the Americans’ sixth straight Olympic triumph    a record stretching to the Atlanta Games of 1996. Day 15: Follow all the Olympic action, Saturday’s win also continued a   Olympic winning streak and was comfortable even by the exacting standards of Team USA. There were   hauls for Diana Taurasi and Lindsay Whalen, with Maya Moore adding 14 of her own. Read: The greatest team you’ve never heard of, Prior to Saturday’s final, the US women had racked up an average margin of victory of 38. 4 points across its seven games in Rio. The closest any team had come was France in the semifinals, and that match still ended with a convincing   win for Team USA. ”It’s pretty incredible,” Taurasi told reporters Saturday. ”We had a goal to win the gold medal but there’s something more to it than that. ”It’s not about one person, one coach    it’s about, ’How can we make this the best basketball team ever? ’” The only competition to that title is likely to come from previous American teams. The US women now have a   Olympic record. The last defeat was the semifinal of the Barcelona Games in 1992 against the CIS    a team comprised of former Soviet republics. When asked about recognition for the team’s sixth consecutive Olympic success, forward Angel McCoughtry said, ”That’s unreal. We need to be on the Wheaties box.” Now, thoughts will turn to building up for another title defense at Tokyo 2020. ”It’s been so awesome I’m kind of sad it’s over,” said Elena Delle Donne, who had 10 points, four rebounds and two assists against Spain. ”But it ended the right way.” The US men will now seek to win their third consecutive title in Sunday’s final against Serbia. Meanwhile, Serbia’s women won bronze Saturday, beating France   in the playoff."
2016-08-21,"  Hillary Clinton’s campaign is halfway to its goal of raising a billion dollars for the 2016 race, according to her finance director. Dennis Cheng announced the achievement on Thursday in a meeting with staff at the campaign’s headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, according to a campaign aide who was present for the meeting but wasn’t authorized to discuss internal campaign strategy and spoke on condition of anonymity. Her campaign has resisted publicizing a fundraising target for the general election, fearing it would draw attention to big donors at a time when voters angry about the role of money in politics. She aimed to raise $100 million for her primary bid. Clinton raised $90 million for her campaign and Democratic party committees in July, according to finance reports released on Saturday. She’s maintained a staff of about 700 for months, opened up offices across the country and already spent $67 million on general election ads. This week, she’ll spend at least $10 million more on ads. GOP rival Donald Trump raised $80 million for his campaign and the Republican party, including a $2 million contribution from Trump himself. He’s kept his payroll to about 70 employees, only began airing ads in recent days and has not undertaken a significant operational buildout across the country. Instead, nearly half the money he spent in July went to one web design firm, whose president is the campaign’s director of digital marketing. Clinton’s campaign is in the midst of a fundraising blitz, with 43 events planned in 14 states over the next two weeks, according to a schedule obtained by The Associated Press.

2016-08-22,"Hands of Stone starts out in a defensive crouch. Over   images of two men beating the snot out of each other, Robert De Niro intones a lazy argument that boxing is, in fact, an art. That’s a conversation for another day, but one thing is for certain: this   biopic of the Panamanian prizefighter Roberto Durán, made in conjunction with the Panamanian Film Commission, is about as subtle and welcome as a blow to the head. Using brute screenwriting force, Hands of Stone creates a parallel story between Durán (Édgar Ramírez, doing the best he can) and his coach, Ray Arcel (De Niro, phoning it in). By the time the two meet, after a Madison Square Garden fight, Durán is already on the rise. He is a natural fighter, but lacks discipline. His power stems from his rage, much of it  . Can he learn to swallow his pride and work with this septuagenarian gringo? Arcel has his own issues. A virtuous man driven only a by a pure love of this noble sport (you know, dudes in their underwear giving each other concussion) Arcel was run out of boxing by the local “wiseguys”. The criminal underworld is represented by flashes of John Turturro, lit by ominous streetlamps, reminding Arcel “We run things!” It’s such a parody, one expects to hear the Saturday Night Live audience laughing after each line. But join forces Durán and Arcel do, and their training sessions aren’t that bad. Wisely, director Jonathan Jakubowicz lets the images do the talking. Kudos to Ramírez for somehow making Durán likable in the first half of this film. He’s cocky and rude and a scene in which he harasses a schoolgirl could be shown to sex offenders undergoing   counselling. Naturally the young woman (played by Ana de Armas) ends up becoming his wife. A montage shows her birthing five children, but the next sequence shows her with the exact same figure, wearing a cropped shirt. Movies! Durán’s career plateaus in 1980 with his first fight against Sugar Ray Leonard (a very charismatic Usher) but it’s here where Hands of Stone’s portrayal pivots from inadvertently obnoxious to intentionally so. (The boxer’s strategy to defeat Leonard included being rude to Leonard’s wife.) Boxing historians may thrill to the contract negotiations between Durán’s untrustworthy business manager (Rubén Blades) and Don King (Reg E Cathey) but most audiences won’t be on the edge of their seats during each negotiating turn planning the Leonard rematch. Late in the game, Hands of Stone hits the panic button and forces some sympathy: Durán grew up poor, so it’s only understandable that he acts like a prick to his family and friends. “He was hungry! Let him eat!” De Niro shouts, in what feels like placeholder dialogue that somehow made the final cut. This is meant to mitigate Durán’s notorious actions in the ring during the second Leonard fight (when the boxer shouted “No more” and ended the fight in the eighth round). One probably has to do that when you have the man himself helping you with publicity for the film. (Somewhere in hell they are planning a double feature of Hands of Stone with the Pelé biopic Birth of a Legend.) But forget good storytelling even as a business venture, Hands of Stone is a failure. It was financed in part by the Panama Film Commission, ostensibly a   programme that, one would assume, wants to boost tourism. Yet the film manages to make Panama look like a dirty, angry place that no one would ever want to visit. This isn’t to say Durán’s upbringing wasn’t troubled, but the way Jakubowicz shoots scenes of blond Americans laughing as they rip up the Panamanian flag is simply ludicrous. One sees   like this and can only say: no más. • Hands of Stone is released in the US on 26 August."

Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF You won’t find hard alcohol at Stanford University parties anymore. At least, that’s what school officials are hoping. In an effort to reduce “the high risk of the rapid consumption of hard alcohol,” the university is banning liquors that are 20 percent alcohol by volume (40 proof) from undergraduate campus parties, while also prohibiting undergraduate students from having   containers that are 750 milliliters or larger in student residences. Student who are of legal age can still drink beer and wine. The new policy is a “harm reduction strategy,” explained Ralph Castro, director of the Office of Alcohol Policy and Education, in a press release. He adds: Our intention is not a total prohibition of a substance, but rather a targeted approach that limits   behavior and has the backing of empirical studies on restricting the availability of and access to alcohol. It also allows us the ability to provide uniformity in a policy that will impact all undergraduate students without banning a substance that is legal for a segment of the student population to use responsibly. By limiting the size of containers to anything less than the size of a wine bottle (capable of pouring out around 17 shots) the university is hoping to reduce alcohol consumption through availability and cost: There are fewer stores that sell hard alcohol in smaller containers, and if students find smaller containers of hard alcohol it costs more to buy those in high quantities. The move comes two months after former Stanford student Brock Turner was sentenced to six months in prison for sexually assaulting an unconscious female student behind a garbage dumpster. Turner blamed alcohol for the incident, as both he and the victim were intoxicated when the assault occurred on January 18, 2015. Following significant national attention to the assault, university leaders said they wanted to start a conversation around “the campus culture around alcohol. ” Critics accused the university of overshadowing Turner’s personal role in the assault, partially blaming the victim’s alcohol consumption. Michele Dauber, a Stanford University Law professor who has become a national voice on the Turner incident, criticized the university’s new policy, tweeting: Sadly . @stanford appears to agree with #BrockTurner that ”alcohol” and ”party culture” are to blame for his conduct. https:  .  There are exceptions to the new rules. Mixed drinks using hard alcohol will be allowed, though, for parties hosted by graduate student organizations. Shots are still prohibited. Students who violate the new policy may be removed from university housing. 	A bartender’s camera captures the seedy street life of retro New York."
2016-08-24,"Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” New York Post columnist Paul Sperry detailed the connections of  Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin had with a radical Muslim journal run by her mother.  Sperry said, “Well, I found one article where the mother actually wrote an article arguing for the subjugation of women and actually excuses wife beating. In another article, I found she actually blamed America and American foreign policy for 911 using the same excuses that Osama bin Laden used in fatwa against us. ” Sperry said Huma Abedin was listed as an assistant editor, “For 12 years from 1996 to 2008. and so, it’s  —   I mean, it’s really hard for the campaign to reconcile this. They admit that she actually was on there, but they’re saying well, she actually didn’t do any editing which is hard to believe because even if you buy that excuse, Huma had to know how odious this radical journal was because her mother was the editor and her brother and sister worked there as editors. ” He continued, “So Hillary had to know too about this. She went over to Saudi Arabia in 2010 as secretary of state to give a speech to the radical mother’s   …     so she went over to this radical girl’s school that’s run by the Huma Abedin’s radical mother and actually apologized for American women wearing bikinis. So I mean, is Hillary really this champion of women’s liberation? I mean, this is very problematic for the campaign because it’s the centerpiece of it is Hillary stands up for women’s rights, but here you have her campaign manager actually publishing articles that oppose women’s rights as  . When asked if Huma Abedin agrees with her mom or Hillary Clinton Sperry said, “That’s a good question. Clearly she has two faces. The face that we all see and then the face that she shows to the Saudis and other radical Muslims. So this raises a lot of questions that unfortunately aren’t being asked of the campaign. I mean, if this was Trump’s campaign manager being attached to such an extremist publication, the media would be hounding him around the clock about this. ” He added, “She could be running the White House as Chief of staff if Hillary gets in. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
2016-08-25,"Donald Trump’s senior communications advisor Jason Miller responded to Hillary Clinton’s “ ” speech, calling it a “desperation play” due to her bad week of news coverage surrounding the alleged    relationship between the state department and the Clinton Foundation when she was secretary of state. [“Hillary Clinton’s attempt to delete the single worst week of her political career isn’t going to work,” Miller proclaimed.  He continued: Her admission that there’s a lot of smoke but no fire is a complete lie, and the American public’s response will be to do exactly as her campaign suggests: don’t vote for her. Clinton’s attempt to blame Colin Powell for her illegal email server backfired, and there’s no way the Clintons could go from dead broke to making more $250 million since leaving office without breaking the law and trading off their access to office. This is exactly why we need a Special Prosecutor to investigate the blurring of lines between the Clinton State Department, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton’s personal bank account. It’s corruption and the rigged system in Washington at its worst, and it’s exactly why we need to vote for a change agent like Donald Trump. After the Associated Press reported earlier this week, more than half of Clinton’s meetings as secretary of state with   officials were with Clinton Foundation donors, the former secretary of state spoke to CNN and attempted to dismiss the reports and allegations of    conduct between the state department and the Clinton Foundation. “I know there’s a lot of smoke, and there’s no fire,” she stated."
2016-08-26," President Robert Mugabe warned protesters on Friday there would be no ”Arab Spring” in Zimbabwe after   demonstrations descended it to some of the worst violence seen in the southern African nation for two decades. Zimbabwean police fired tear gas and water cannon at opposition leaders and hundreds of demonstrators at a protest against Mugabe and the ruling   before unrest swept across large parts of the capital Harare. ”They are thinking that what happened in the Arab Spring is going to happen in this country but we tell them that it is not going to happen here,” Mugabe told state television, referring to a series of uprisings that toppled leaders across the Arab world. Mugabe accused Western countries, including the United States, of sponsoring the protests. ”They are fighting because of Americans,” said Mugabe.     Earlier, opposition head Morgan Tsvangirai and former vice president Joice Mujuru fled a rally in their cars while protesters ran for cover as police broke up the core of the demonstration. However,   leaders warned that this would be the first of a series of protests. Mugabe’s opponents have become emboldened by rising public anger and protests over an economic meltdown, cash shortages and high unemployment. Mugabe, 92, has led Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980. Clashes spread through the streets of the capital Harare as riot police fought running battles with protesters who hurled rocks at officers, set tyres ablaze and burned a popular market to the ground, in some of the worst unrest since food riots in 1998. Didymus Mutasa, a senior official from Mujuru’s party and convener of Friday’s protest, vowed to repeat the demonstration a week from now and blamed police for the violence and disobeying a court order allowing the march to proceed. ”If that was intended to cow us from demonstrating, I want to say the opposite has been the case. We are going next Friday to do exactly the same as we have done today,” Mutasa told reporters. Most businesses shut down early on Friday fearing looting by protesters. Mujuru said 50 people were injured and hospitalized. ”Mugabe’s rule must end now, that old man has failed us,” said one protester before throwing a rock at a taxi. RIOT POLICE More than a hundred police officers in riot gear, backed up by water cannons and armored trucks, occupied the venue that opposition parties planned to use for their demonstration. As opposition supporters arrived for the march, they were told by the police to leave. The officers then fired tear gas and water cannon when parts of the crowd refused to comply. Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said the force was still assessing the day’s events. ”We will let you know once we are done,” she said. Officials from Mugabe’s ruling   party were unavailable for comment. ”Demonstrating is the only solution left to force the dictator out of office,” said Tapfuma Make, an unemployed    from Chitungwiza town, south of Harare. Zimbabwe’s High Court earlier ruled that police should allow the protest to proceed between 12 p. m.   4 p. m. (6. 00 a. m. . 00 a. m. ET) in what Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) called a ”victory for democracy”. ”Today has been for me the worst day that I have lived in this country, where I have observed with my own eyes, the state breaking its own laws and the state starting violence by attacking people who were just gathered together,” Mutasa said.     Opposition parties leading the protests say the electoral agency is biased in favor of the ruling   and is run by security agents loyal to Mugabe, charges the commission denies. The protesters want the next vote in 2018 to be supervised by international observers, including the United Nations. They are also calling for Mugabe to fire corrupt ministers, scrap plans to introduce local bank notes and end cash shortages. The latest demonstrations come nearly two months after the biggest large scale ’stay at home’ strike in Zimbabwe since 2007, inspired by social media movements such as #ThisFlag led by pastor Evan Mawarire. Home Affairs Minister Ignatius Chombo on Thursday called opposition leaders ”foreign agents” using protests to cause chaos in order to justify international intervention.

2016-08-27,"The death of NBA star Dwyane Wade’s first cousin, shot as she was pushing her baby in a stroller on the sidewalk in a South Side neighborhood, is once again casting a bloody shadow over the City of Chicago. [Nykea Aldridge, 32, was out walking her baby in her Parkway Gardens neighborhood on the city’s south side on Friday afternoon when two men standing nearby began exchanging gunfire. Aldridge was caught in the crossfire. She was struck in the arm and head. The mother of four was pronounced dead shortly afterward at a nearby hospital. The child was protected by a neighbor and was not injured.  Chicago Police have questioned several people but no charges have yet been filed, ABC News reports. The young woman had only recently returned to Chicago and family said she had just enrolled her oldest child in the city’s schools. Aldridge is the cousin of Chicago Bulls player and Chicago native Dwyane Wade.

2016-08-28,"When Meg was 12, her mother, Annie, found herself unable to look at her. Seeing her daughter made Annie feel unsettled, at times almost angry. At first, she couldn’t figure out why.  “And then, Meg turned 13 and suddenly, everything slid into place for me,” Annie says.  “I found myself thinking, ‘She’s so tiny. She is so little.’ And I realised I was actually talking about myself, not her.  “It felt like something just broke. It was something big and ugly, and it just broke. ”  Annie was 13 in 1987 when an Anglican priest began sexually abusing her, over a period of eight to 10 months. Seeing her daughter turn the same age was a trigger that not only bring back memories of the abuse, but that also helped her to comprehend just how small and innocent she would have been.  He was in his mid 30s, and used Annie’s vulnerability after the acrimonious divorce of her parents and his knowledge that she had been sexually abused by a family member to his advantage. Annie’s experience of   betrayal and being failed by those who should have protected her has become all too familiar in such cases. But it is the experience of her family members she wants to highlight. They are the secondary victims, whose stories are often lost. Annie and her family believe abuse pervades the lives of secondary victims but support for them is haphazard and scarce. They hope that by sharing their experiences, religious and other institutions will do more to recognise and address the impact of abuse beyond the primary victim.  Meg said at first she was unsure why her mother had begun to treat her differently. She did not know the extent of her mother’s abuse at the time. “I guess it was always obvious that something had happened to Mum, because sometimes she would cry or blank out but I didn’t know exactly what she was upset about,” Meg, now 14, says. “But when I first turned 13 that’s kind of when I knew something more was going on. For a while though, I thought I’d just done something wrong, I thought I’d upset Mum in some way and that’s why she couldn’t really talk to me any more. ”  Annie was first raped when the priest lured her alone into the church where he preached. Knowing that Annie was devastated about the death of her dog, the priest told her that if she looked toward the altar and prayed to God, she would see her beloved pet again. He made her lean towards the pew and, as she did, he pulled down her underwear and sexually abused her. Annie’s police statement was made last year, when she was 42.   “After I got home there was a lot of blood there and it hurt for a while,” it said. “For around two weeks, I remember I had a lot of trouble going to the toilet. ” Annie recalls the priest raping her five times. She is unsure why the abuse eventually stopped. But it she says it robbed her of her childhood and left her without an identity, unable to accept love, her victim impact statement said.  By the time she was in year 12, Annie had a nervous breakdown. Her former high marks at school crashed. Her mother threw her out of home for several weeks, forcing Annie to steal food from garbage bins to survive.  When her mother accepted her back home, Annie was terrified of starving again, and began to eat as much as she could and to hide food in her bedroom. Between 1991 and 1992, Annie gained 30kg.  In 1994 Annie’s mother made her talk about her withdrawn and surly behaviour to a bishop her mother was friends with.   Annie brought up the name of her perpetrator to the bishop. He told her: “I’m going to stop you here. ” “I want you to think very carefully about coming forward with this,” Annie recalls him telling her. “Think of the lives that could be ruined by this. ”  The bishop questioned Annie’s memory of what happened and told her that if she told anyone else, people would think she wanted it, that she was partly responsible.  Letters written by church officials at the time and seen by Guardian Australia reveal that senior members of the church knew of the priest’s abusing but did nothing. Annie’s mother called her a slut and a whore. She accused her daughter of breaking up the family by causing trouble. Though she was awarded a scholarship to attend a prestigious college in 1994, Annie dropped out after less than a year. That same year, when she was 21, she tried to take her life.  She has since worked in   jobs where people half her age serve as her boss. She cannot go near churches, even for funerals or weddings. She dreads sleep because of the nightmares she knows will come. She has considered and attempted suicide more than once. Annie’s husband, Mark, and her three children, Robert, Meg, and Ella, do not know the full extent of her abuse, though they know most of the crucial details. As the years go by, they learn more, sometimes accidentally, such as when Annie talks in her sleep. Or sometimes, by necessity, as the calls from detectives and from the church require an explanation. Dr Judy Courtin, a lawyer representing victims of institutional sex abuse at Angela Sdrinis Legal, published research last year into justice outcomes for sexual assault victims abused within the Catholic church. She interviewed 18 secondary victims  —   defined as immediate family members  —   and found an admission of guilt by the perpetrator was important to them. “But an even bigger concern I found from them was their anger at the ongoing way the church concealed the crimes, and a need for those people to also be held to account,” Courtin says. “They felt that those who knew about paedophiles and yet kept quiet fundamentally enabled the activities of paedophiles. They protected them, they covered up their crimes, and they were often not held to account, and that’s something that really upsets secondary victims. That maybe their family member wouldn’t have been abused if those who knew had spoken up. ” The finding resonates with Annie’s son, Robert. He learned about the abuse of his mother just before Christmas, after he had finished his year 10 exams. Annie and Mark had been talking to detectives and representatives from the Anglican church and they felt it was time Robert knew what was going on. He is angered most by the fact that no one had helped his mother. “It’s almost worse, not helping when you can see something is wrong,” Robert says. “I’m a firm believer that if you see or know about something wrong you have to do something. If you hide something like this happening to someone it’s wrong. ”  “They [the church] should also know that the effect isn’t just on that one person.  “It’s like a web. Like a spider that keeps on building its web, things like this just keep building. I’m not the only one who has been affected, my friends have, too, even if they don’t know it, because they see how I am affected. They don’t know what the cause is, and they won’t for a while. But they see something is wrong. ” Robert says he feels angry that he cannot always talk about the problem with friends or adults who “think the world is safe and simple”. “But it’s not. Because sometimes I come home and I’ve got Mum going through this. I’ve got Ella, who doesn’t really know what’s going on, but who is asking questions every day. She’s always confused and always wants to know more. And I’ve got Meg, who is lashing out because of it. And it’s painful at times. ” There is no support group, no place to go outside his family, Robert says, for other teenagers like him. He thinks a safe environment for other children of survivors to meet and talk in would help. “It’s something I would like to be involved in,” he says. Annie has looked into it. But she says there are significant gaps in accessing support and even counselling for survivors and their families. Survivors often have to bear substantial costs of private counselling, while civil claims against the church may also be draining their funds. Annie’s husband, Mark, says he learned about Annie’s abuse shortly after they started dating in 1996, though she wasn’t necessarily upfront about it. He would hear her call out in her sleep, and ask her the next morning about some of the things she had said. Over the years, Annie has gradually told Mark more. Since Annie first told her story to police last year, Mark has learned about the extent her perpetrator went to to harm her. But there were times while giving her statement that Annie would not allow Mark to stay in the room. “I was very stressed by that,” he says. “There were just two cops and a video camera, and she’s telling them things she doesn’t want me to hear. “I’m thinking, ‘These are the points where she’s at her most vulnerable and that’s the moment she really needs someone she trusts and knows loves her to be there with her.’ “And there’s stuff I still don’t know,” Mark says.  It took Annie 19 years of Mark gently encouraging her before she went to police in January last year. Mark had to walk a delicate line between supporting Annie in whatever choice she made, while also navigating his own anger towards the perpetrator and the church.  She was fearful that if she went to police, Mark would learn the full extent of her abuse, and that knowing the details might prove too much for him to bear. “Mark’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me,” Annie says. “You don’t muck around with that. ” He replies: “This is what it’s like to be someone who supports a survivor.  “I know what I can’t handle. Of course there are things that will break a human. But this isn’t that. The things that I’m vulnerable to aren’t these things. But despite 20 years of trying, Annie can’t trust me when I say that.  “And that’s my struggle. I’ve got to live with the fact that Annie can’t completely trust me the way I’d like her to, the way I trust her. And I just have to accept that. That’s part of the package. She can’t completely trust me. She can’t completely trust anyone. “She’s still convinced that there are things, when I hear about them, that will be it. “That I’ll never be able to look at her again. ”  Mark says he feels a certain sense of relief now that Annie’s attacker has been charged with 16 offences. He will face court next month. He had been jailed before, in 1996, for child sexual abuse offences unrelated to Annie. “I found it’s easier for me since Annie came forward than it was before, because now it’s out in the open. While I’m not telling everyone I know, I feel I can talk about my feelings about how angry I am with the church and the people who covered this up more safely. ” Shireen Gunn is the manager of the Centre Against Sexual Assault in Ballarat, a town that has been deeply affected by child sexual abuse within religious institutions. As well as primary victims, the centre works with the family members of those who were abused.  Disclosure often comes as a relief to them, she says. “For many family members of survivors, especially the children of parents who have been abused, everything suddenly makes sense to them once the victim discloses that abuse,” Gunn says. “Suddenly certain aspects of their childhood or behaviours from their parent start to make sense, it helps them to make sense of their experience. “The other response from secondary victims is, of course, anger. They want to do something to hold their family member’s perpetrator to account. But it’s very important that the victim or survivor have control over what happens, and if and when they take action or go to police. ” There is little research on the impact of sexual assault on secondary victims, the Australian Institute of Family Studies says. “To the extent that secondary victims are considered in the literature, the focus is usually on the manner in which their response to the  ’s experiences helps or hinders the primary victim’s recovery,” the institute says. “This is an important concern. Higher levels of unsupportive behaviour by family members has been found to be more likely for sexual assault victims than for victims of   assaults. ” But few studies had examined the trauma experienced by someone finding out a family member had been sexually abused, the institute says. The royal commission into institutional responses into child sexual abuse acknowledges the lack of research. A commission spokeswoman told Guardian Australia a comprehensive research program is under way looking at survivors and their families. But the commission does not yet have statistics about how many secondary victims of abuse survivors there might be. “The research projects under way are exploring a number of questions: what are the impacts of child sexual abuse on families of minors? What are the impacts of child sexual abuse on the intimate partners and children of child sexual abuse survivors? And what are the support needs of the families of child and adult child sexual abuse survivors?” she says. Annie says there is not enough acknowledgement of the quiet role secondary victims play in trying to be supportive while grappling with their anger and sadness. While telling her family about the extent of her abuse has been difficult, especially while also repeating her story to members of the church, the royal commission and police, Annie says the experience has ultimately proved worthwhile. “There is a certain kind of freedom that comes with coming forward,” she says. “The process is flawed, it’s not right, it’s not OK, and survivors and their families deserve better. Supporters need to know the way you say things has the potential to horribly damage a survivor who is already struggling under the weight of coming forward. “But you can also help amplify a silent voice. I am a person coming forward and coming forward means that you are saying you are a person. You’re not a thing.  “Nobody has the right to use you.  “You’re real. You exist. Your survival means you have the right to peace in your life.  “You have the right to be able to look at your own kids. ” • The names of Meg, Annie and the names of all the family members are pseudonyms.  • The reporter, Melissa Davey, can be contacted at melissa. davey@theguardian. com, • For a list of child sexual abuse support services in Australia click here.

2016-08-30,"  In the latest step of an ongoing effort to heal the mistrust between Chicago law enforcement and city residents, the head of the police department formally moved to fire five officers involved in the fatal shooting of teenager Laquan McDonald in 2014.  Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson filed administrative charges against Officers Jason Van Dyke, Janet Mondragon, Daphne Sebastian, Ricardo Viramontes and Sgt. Stephen Franko on Tuesday. Their cases will be heard by the Chicago Police Board, which will rule if the officers will be terminated. The proceedings will begin September 19 with an initial status hearing.  A statement given to CNN by the department says the officers gave false statements during the investigation into McDonald’s death.  A sixth officer the department included in the administrative charges has resigned, police said.  CNN attempted to reach the police union Tuesday evening but a spokesman was unavailable for comment.  Earlier this month the city’s Office of the Inspector General recommended the termination of eight officers, but police disagreed with one of those, CPD said at the time. The status of that officer is unclear. Two other officers retired. Inside Chicago’s broken trust: Can release of police videos begin healing? Sixteen bullets, Dashcam video of the shooting contradicted nearly everything police said happened the night McDonald died in October 2014. It showed McDonald walking away from police as he held a   knife, not lunging toward officers, as police had said. Van Dyke jumped out of his vehicle and pulled his gun, firing at McDonald six seconds after arriving on the scene. Van Dyke continued to fire, unloading every round from his gun in 15 seconds. The video appears to show McDonald’s body getting hit by bullets even after he was on the ground. All 16 bullets struck McDonald, 17. It took 400 days to release the dashcam video to the public. After the city’s objections, a judge ordered the release in November 2015. Chicago: The shocking numbers behind the violence, Officer pleaded not guilty to murder, Van Dyke became the first Chicago officer charged with   murder since 1980. He has pleaded not guilty to six counts of   murder.  If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.  State’s attorney in Laquan McDonald killing asks for special prosecutor, Years of mistrust, In April, a report from the newly formed Police Accountability Task Force said police ”have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color” and have alienated blacks and Hispanics with the use of force and a longstanding code of silence. During the past eight years, 74% of people killed or injured by Chicago police officers were   the report said. The task force, which included five Chicagoans who have been leaders in the justice system, found that 72% of people stopped by Chicago police in 2014 were   and 17% were Hispanic. Father Pfleger: There’s a trust gap among police, youth, Mayor Rahm Emanuel created the city task force in response to public outcry for accountability and transparency after the release of the McDonald shooting video in late November. Tension in the city, which had built for years, had reached a fever pitch with protesters calling for Emanuel and other city leaders to step down. Demonstrators were outraged not just about the content of the video, but that it took 13 months to release it. On December 1, Emanuel announced he had asked police Superintendent Garry McCarthy to resign, and McCarthy complied. To address the slew of systemic issues within the police department, the Police Accountability Task Force report recommended nearly 100 changes. Emanuel has announced the implementation of nearly   of those recommendations, including replacing Independent Police Review Authority with an agency that has ”more independence.” The US Justice Department is also investigating the police department. Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the number of police officers facing administrative charges. "
2016-08-31," Only the naive have ever believed that democracy is solely a noble contest over competing ideas, proposals and solutions. Emotion looms large in every human decision, including how we cast our ballots, and smart politicians have always blended appeals to the heart and the gut with their entreaties to reason.  We cherish what might be called the   approach to politics, inspired by the 1858 debates between Honest Abe and “The Little Giant,” Stephen Douglas, when the two candidates went from place to place in Illinois arguing with great eloquence about the future of slavery. But we forget that even in those debates, emotion was often in the saddle. Racism was at work, and so was a passionate anger at “the Slave Power,” the popular term in the North for the domination of the federal government by Southern planters. For decades, political scientists have blasted away at electoral models based primarily on the idea of rational choice. In the most recent and sophisticated entry in the field, “Democracy for Realists,” Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels argue that even   and politically engaged voters mostly choose candidates based on their social identities and partisan loyalties. Judging from the 2016 polls, that theory looks pretty good. And in a brilliant article for Vox, Lee Drutman of the New America Foundation shows how Donald Trump, far from being an aberration from the trajectory of Republican politics, is instead “a historical culmination ” of a strategy rooted in racial feeling. The irony for Republicans, he notes, is that “this strategy reached its full completion at precisely the moment when it was no longer a winning national strategy. ” In an increasingly nonwhite country in which the younger and better educated are relatively liberal on matters of diversity, Trump has divided voters on race and immigration in a way that worked in the Republican primaries but is failing him with the broader electorate.     Speaking after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto Aug. 31, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said they did not discuss the payment for the border wall that he has pledged to build and have Mexico pay for. (The Washington Post)   Drutman’s insight explains Trump’s whirls and twirls over his approach to immigration, as well as his sudden visit to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and his evasively anodyne statement afterward. Trump is asking some to believe that he is an authentic nativist and racist who really thinks Mexican immigrants are “rapists,” and more     voters to see him as a fake nativist and racist willing to adjust to whatever position will make them breathe easier. One way or the other, how can anyone with strong commitments on any issue now support Trump? Rarely has a candidate embarked upon such an extended public negotiation with himself over the core promise of his campaign  —   and Trumpism has been about immigration if it has been about anything. Imagine the campaign manager for any other candidate saying what Kellyanne Conway said this month about Trump’s position on his signature issue. It was, she said, “to be determined. ” What would have happened to Ronald Reagan’s campaign manager if, at this point in the 1980 campaign, he had said that the Gipper’s views on communism or taxes were “to be determined”? Or if a top Barack Obama aide had said the same in 2008 about his view of the Iraq War? Have a candidate’s political strategists ever before treated their candidate like a rambunctious child and spoken of their pride that they finally coaxed him to “stay on message”? The   boy may send out the offensive tweet now and again, but look how much better he’s being! And don’t you have to admire his gift for large gestures, like suddenly throwing a trip to Mexico on his schedule? Trump’s indifference to truth and consistency is what happens when the honest efforts of political scientists to grapple with the balance between the rational and irrational in politics become an excuse for absolute cynicism  —   about voters, their attention spans and democracy itself. Return to Lincoln and Douglas: Yes, they used emotion, but each also had carefully considered, strongly held views about slavery and the Union. The politicians we most respect try to persuade their fellow citizens not simply to vote for them but also to share at least some of their view of the world. Political realists are right to challenge purely idealistic views of politics that mislead us into ignoring the role of power, group interest and the imperfections of all of us who vote. But the democratic idea is in grave jeopardy when citizens simply shrug over being manipulated and don’t expect more from their political leaders than posturing, positioning and captivating media circuses.

2016-09-01," Volkswagen AG ( ) said on Thursday it has filed an appeal of a federal labor board decision on its dispute with the United Auto Workers union in Tennessee to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The National Labor Relations board on Aug. 26 sided with the UAW in the union’s effort to get VW to negotiate wages and benefits for about 160 of the 1, 500 hourly workers at a VW plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Thursday’s filing was expected. The NLRB decision for the UAW in the dispute was highly anticipated, and VW had previously said it would appeal if the ruling went against the   company. The union sought to represent only a portion of the plant’s workers after it in February 2014 narrowly lost an election to represent all 1, 500 hourly workers at the Chattanooga plant. In December 2015, the union handily won the right to represent about 160 skilled trades workers who maintain machinery at the plant. The UAW has never been able to win an organizing vote at a   auto assembly plant in the U. S. south. A victory, even for only a portion of workers at the VW plant, would give the union a stronger foothold in the south, where most   auto plants are located. On Thursday, VW said in a statement that it ”respects the right of all of our employees to decide the question of union representation. This is why we disagree with the decision to separate Volkswagen maintenance and production workers and will continue our effort to allow everyone to vote as one group on the matter of union representation.”   UAW   Gary Casteel said in a statement on Thursday evening that the union is ”disappointed that Volkswagen is continuing to thumb its nose at the federal government. The federal courts have consistently upheld the NLRB labor standard that enabled the   vote in Chattanooga.” The UAW has for several years been assisted in its effort to organize workers in Tennessee by the powerful German union IG Metall, which has members on the VW Supervisory Board. Earlier on Thursday, the head of IG Metall, Joerg Hofman,  demanded that VW enter talks with the   workers. IG Metall in a statement said that Hofman ”is calling for VW to no longer act contrary to American labor law, and to seek talks with UAW without delay.”  (Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Bernard Orr) BRUSSELS French carmaker PSA Group  secured unconditional EU antitrust approval on Wednesday to acquire General Motors’  German unit Opel, a move which will help it better compete with market leader Volkswagen .

2016-09-02,"In Fiddler on the Roof, the milkman Tevye imagines what life would be like “If I Were a Rich Man. ” Among the shrewder lyrics is the insight that “the most important men in town will come to fawn on me” and pose questions that would “cross a rabbi’s eyes. ” Why? Because “when you’re rich, they think you really know. ” One cannot guess how much credibility Donald Trump gains through his reputation for business acumen, but it’s safe to say, it’s quite a lot. He trades, both in entertainment and in politics (if there’s still a distinction) on his reputation as a tycoon, which might be one reason for his refusal (despite pledges) to release his tax returns. Trump’s “brand” is everything. When Tim O’Brien authored a book questioning Trump’s net worth, Trump sued him and, after lengthy litigation, lost. On paper, Perot was far more suited to the Oval Office than the   star who currently bestrides the Republican party. Perot was raised in modest circumstances, served honorably in the U. S. Navy, married his college sweetheart, started his own business (Electronic Data Services) received a medal for Distinguished Public Service for his efforts to secure the release of U. S. prisoners of war in Vietnam, and personally rescued two EDS employees who were held hostage in Iran. He sold his business to GM for $2. 5 billion, so he was a bona fide billionaire. He had a   style. Neither Democrat nor Republican, he disparaged the intelligence of all elites and leaders. His favorite   delivered with a West Texas drawl, was “not too smart. ” He would get “under the hood” and fix the country, he vowed. The wag who quipped “he’s a   man who worships his creator” could have had Perot in mind. But there was another side to Perot that came into focus as his campaign unfolded. He was no economic genius. People presumed that because he was rich, he “really knew. ” But his chief bugaboo, after deficits, was NAFTA. He famously predicted that if the   deal were signed, there would be a “giant sucking sound” of jobs leaving the U. S. for Mexico. It was signed, and in the years following its enactment, the U. S. enjoyed an economic boom, creating 2 million jobs a year for six years starting in 1994. (Some jobs were lost, but on net the economy thrived.) Canada and Mexico benefited as well, with Mexico’s economy expanding enough to diminish the tide of illegal migrants seeking to cross the U. S. border. Mexico now purchases more U. S. goods than Brazil, Russia, India, and China combined. It’s odd that people who’ve done well in business should imagine that commerce is unhealthy. This paranoia  —   a     approach to the world  —   is the red thread that links the Perot and Trump worldviews and campaigns. Perot’s populist appeals were eventually upstaged by his erratic behavior (he dropped out of the race and then jumped back in) and peculiar obsessions. Like Trump, Perot was a devotee of conspiracy theories. He believed that the U. S. Defense Department was running a vast   and   enterprise throughout Latin America and Southeast Asia. He was sure that Vietnam had sent a gang of Black Panthers to kill him and his family, and that Texas drug smugglers had targeted him as well. He explained his abrupt withdrawal from the presidential race on a plot by President George H. W. Bush to disrupt his daughter’s wedding. Belief in conspiracies conveys at best poor understanding and at worst mental instability. Trump has displayed the same weakness, endorsing the    myth, the     canard, the Clintons —  killed —  Vince Foster rumor, the Rafael Cruz —       nonsense, and many more crackpot theories. Worst and most pernicious are the conspiracies he conjures himself  —   that the “system is rigged,” that thousands of American Muslims celebrated   but the footage has been suppressed, and that if he loses, it can be due only to fraud. Republicans were relieved in 1992 to see Perot unmasked as unstable. Perhaps, after 2016, they will fall out of love with addled businessmen forever.,"
2016-09-03,"In his book Politics and the English Language, George Orwell wrote, “it is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy  …    . Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. ”[Seventy years later, Orwell’s insight on the use and abuse of the English language still rings true. Take for example, the   attack on Hungary for being “undemocratic. ”  In May, Bill Clinton said that Hungary and Poland “decided this democracy is too much trouble” and that they “want   leadership: ‘just give me an authoritarian dictatorship and keep the foreigners out. ’” He was attacking  —   and slandering  —   Hungary for blocking the entry of a few hundred thousand Muslim migrants, many of them from Syria. Last October, Rob Berschinski, the Obama’s Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, visited Hungary to lecture about the Obama administration’s “concerns with the democratic backsliding in Hungary. ” Just as Orwell said, Clinton and the Obama administration called Hungary undemocratic because they don’t like its immigration policies. It’s hard to see what is “undemocratic” about responding to the needs and expressed demands of “we the people. ” In fact, Hungary is acting very democratically by holding a referendum to ask the Hungarian people this question: “Do you want the European Union to be able, even without the approval of the Hungarian parliament, to prescribe mandatory relocation of   nationals to Hungary?” By any sensible or traditional definition, democracy means rule of the people  —   the people of each nation. Hungary is one of the few Europeans governments which is allowing its citizens to themselves decide the nation’s immigration policy as opposed to globalist bureaucrats from Brussels. In response to the   slander, California Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, came to Hungary’s defense. He explained the situation perfectly, noting, “Hungary was totally justified in what it is doing to try to stem the flow” of refugees and that the State Department should not attack it for “trying to protect the national sovereignty of its own country. ” Of course, the Clinton Global Initiative and Obama’s State Department have a different view of democracy —   in Europe and elsewhere. To a globalist like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, the government of Hungary is acting undemocratically if it does not submit to the decisions of the “people” of the “” the European Union. To a globalist, Hungary’s borders are archaic fictions. Fortunately, the people of Hungary have not bowed to this arrogance. Unlike Hungarians, Americans have never been asked whether they want to transform their country through mass immigration. In contrast to democratic Hungary, for the past fifty years Americans have not been allowed to choose their immigration policies. In the United States, political elites have conspired to erode border controls despite public opposition. When Congress voted to resume mass immigration with Sen. Ted Kennedy’s 1965 Immigration Act, the bill’s goals were misrepresented to the American people. Advocates claimed, in the words of Sen. Kennedy, the bill would not “inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations” and that “our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. ” Yet the 1965 law did exactly that  —   and since then, neither political party has acted to bring mass immigration under control. Poll after poll has showed that Americans want secure borders, reduced immigration and our immigration laws enforced. Yet, Congress continues to debate bills that grant immediate amnesty on the promise of eventual border security —  not today, but sometime in the future. The only time Congress summoned the courage to demand the building of a border wall, the Secure Fence Act of 2006, it passed in a lame duck session. Lawmakers back peddled the next year by refusing to fund the legislation. A recent Pew Center poll shows that even among Hispanic citizens, twice as many people want immigration reduced as want it increased —  35 percent versus 18 percent. Yet, for decades corporate interests have ensured that both parties do not nominate a candidate who will offer a serious alternative. George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney held views on mass immigration not all that different from those of Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama. This November 8, 2016, that betrayal of American democracy may end: Americans will finally have a choice. One major party candidate, Donald Trump, promises to protect American sovereignty. Three others promise to continue our open borders policies. That Americans are being offered a choice has Washington’s policy establishment in a state of panic. Trump and his supporters are denounced as nativists, nationalists, and fascists for suggesting our politicians put American interests ahead of mass immigration and the admission of jihadist refugees. Yet the vicious   has not changed the landscape: a large majority of American citizens clearly want secure borders and an end to illegal entry. While candidate Donald Trump needs to clarify some of his immigration proposals, his priority for border security offers a clear contrast to the priorities championed by Hillary Clinton. For example, Trump has consistently supported building a border wall and keeping unvetted Syrian refugees out of the country. Hungary and Israel have already proven that fences do work, and the American people are tired of excuses, lies and hyperbole. European countries like Germany, Belgium, Sweden, and France have allowed entry by millions of Muslim refugees, leading to escalating incidents of mass sexual assault, murder and terrorism, and London now has a Muslim Mayor —  elected by a political party now dependent on the Muslim vote. Hungary has avoided these consequences by simply keeping the refugees out. That policy is proving very popular and successful. Border control is about more than combating terrorism. Because Islam’s Shariah Law is deeply hostile to Western norms, values and legal institutions, the millions of law abiding Muslims not engaged in jihad are still altering the culture of Europe. Civil liberties, religious tolerance and political democracy are incompatible with orthodox, devout Islam. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban sounded a lot like Donald Trump when he said in February of this year, “We want to import no crime, terrorism, homophobia or   to Hungary. ” In spite of opposition from the EU, Hungary has constructed a border fence, and contrary to the claims that these fences are impossible to create and will bankrupt the country, its 100 miles of fencing on the Serbian border cost approximately $100 million. The border wall in Hungary has been such a success they are extending it to the Croatian border. While the US Mexican Border is much longer —  1, 954 miles  —   at that rate, it would cost less than $2 billion compared to the $50 billion critics claim. It goes without saying that I do not support all of the Hungary’s policies. But on the key issues of national sovereignty and border control, issues affecting its survival and the survival of all Western nations, it has admirably represented the interests of its citizens. Rather than attack Hungary as undemocratic for cracking down on unlawful refugees, Americans should look to them as an inspiration for how to adopt a truly democratic immigration policy. In the United States, we do not have national referenda, we have presidential elections. But the 2016 election has become a de facto referendum on immigration policy and secure borders. That referendum is long overdue."
2016-09-04,"After 25 years of teaching, Rick Young won’t return to his history classroom this fall. ”This became my home,” he says. ”This is a unique, special place,” talking about Daniel C. Oakes High School, where he has spent his entire career. It’s a small public school outside Denver for students who’ve struggled with traditional education. For some, it’s their third or fourth try at high school  —   and they know it’s probably the last stop. And many, because of teachers like Young, finally find success. Like Ryan Hostetler. He says he didn’t expect to finish high school. Then he met Young. ”He’s the most effective writing teacher I’ve ever had the experience of being taught by, and that includes literature writing classes at the graduate level,” he says. After graduating, Hostetler decided to become a teacher, too. ”I wanted to make the same sort of difference in people’s lives that Rick made in my life,” he says. Hostetler now teaches at Daniel C. Oakes. Even though that gives Young all the pride in the world, he says the profession of teaching has changed too dramatically. ”It’s become a lot harder to teach and especially to teach in a way that I personally think is meaningful for my students,” he says. Young is talking about a national trend in teaching to more clearly document and measure what’s taught  —   it’s meant to keep teachers accountable. That’s led to a shift for teachers toward standardizing lesson planning. Because of that, sometimes he felt like he had to make sure he was still actually teaching history. Young says lessons must be written in the form of a ”backward design.” That is a   framework. It begins with detailing his desired results and how students will be assessed, and finally explaining how he will provide learning experiences and opportunities for practice and application. Teachers are told to strive for a ”  outcome” based on the Colorado Academic Standards, which are required items students must learn. For example, that could call for strategically creating meaning through complex writing and speaking, and defending metacognitive process in a quantitative and qualitative method. Young has all of these instructions taped to his wall. And there’s more: ”I’ve got to make sure the lesson focuses on a 21st century skill,” he says, which could mean civic responsibility, financial literacy, global awareness, health and wellness, problem solving, resiliency and systems thinking, among others. There’s still more. Young sums it up like this: ”Everything’s very  . In my mind, it’s not productive time,” he says. ”It’s not helping my students. It limits the freedom of teachers to really freely teach and of principals to freely lead and evaluate.” The district and national backers of this methodical planning say it creates the   classrooms, freeing teachers to teach what they want while giving them   lessons and activities that push kids to think at a higher level and lead their own learning. Young believes it left him less time for creativity and began to take a physical and mental toll as well. When he decided not to return this fall, his fellow teachers gave him a book of memories to take with him. Some students wrote to him, too. ”I’m grateful for all the eggs of knowledge you cracked over my head,” one of them wrote. Another was grateful for Young’s creating a safe space for students to learn and converse with ”grace and respect.” And then there’s this note on the back of a photocopied assignment: ”We students from Oakes were not the average students that ever had an easy life. We didn’t quite fit the mold. But you, as well as all of the teachers at Oakes, took us in and treated us as if we were your most prized possessions. It helped us want to become more.”"
2016-09-05,"Free Speech Defense and Jihad Watch have accused Google of skewing their search results to promote a post from the Islamic Supreme Council defending Jihad as a “misunderstood concept” when searching for “jihad. ”[In their claims, they detail that when searching for the word “Jihad,” the Islamic Supreme Council’s article appears directly below the Wikipedia definition at the top of nearly 32 million results, despite having a global Alexa rating of just 567, 527.  Jihad Watch, which appears in the search results one place below the Islamic Supreme Council, has a global Alexa rank of 25, 092. “The concept of jihad has been hijacked by many political and religious groups over the ages in a bid to justify various forms of violence. In most cases, Islamic splinter groups invoked jihad to fight against the established Islamic order. Scholars say this misuse of jihad contradicts Islam,” says the post on the Islamic Supreme Council’s site. “Jihad is not a violent concept  …     Jihad is not a declaration of war against other religions. ” “Anyone doing a search for Jihad, will think they are seeing an opposing, authoritative view of JihadWatch’s, but the ‘Islamic Supreme Council’ is of no authority, it’s poor in every way, but the Googler will read all about all this peaceful unrepresentative Jihad, trusting Google,” wrote Free Speech Defense in their claims. So how about another site which might be more of an authority on Jihad in the US, cair. com (Council on   Relations) is constantly being updated, is far more popular at 146, 590th place, actually probably even more so as it has a vast network of sites, a search for jihad site:cair. com gives 342 results, and is mentioned and linked to a wopping 60 million times, it’s mobile friendly and has HTTPS enabled, and it’s not even on the top 10 pages of results for a search on Jihad. Odd. In July, searches for “presidential candidates” would only reveal three names at the top of Google’s search results: Hillary Rodham Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Jill Stein. After the absences of Republican Party candidate Donald Trump and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson were revealed, Google blamed the results on a “technical bug” rather than manipulation. Claims that Google have been manipulating other search results in favor of Hillary Clinton have also been prominent during this election, with negative Clinton suggestions frequently being ruled out from searches, despite being top search suggestions on other engines. WikiLeaks founder and Editor Julian Assange claimed that Google was “directly engaged in Hillary Clinton’s campaign” at a journalism forum in June, adding that should Clinton be elected, many   Google employees would be “placed into positions around the new Clinton presidency. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Army Corps of Engineers says it does not oppose the temporary halt of construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline, a $3. 8 billion oil pipeline slated to run through four states, including North Dakota. As we’ve reported, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe opposes the pipeline because it fears it could disturb sacred sites and affect the drinking water. Earlier this summer, the tribe filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, arguing that the Army Corps did not follow proper procedure when it gave   Energy Transfer Partners the go ahead to build the pipeline. Over the weekend, the tribe filed an emergency motion asking the court to halt construction of the pipeline. In one filing, Tim Mentz Sr. who helped start the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Tribal Historic Preservation Office, said bulldozers had likely dug through burial grounds with little regard and without allowing members of the tribe a chance to look for human remains. The Army Corps replied saying it did not oppose a temporary halt to construction. The Corps said it was comfortable with the process it followed when it permitted the project in first place and that the tribe was unlikely to succeed with its lawsuit. Still, it acknowledged the confrontations that have occurred between private security officers at the construction site and protesters. (As we reported, one demonstration over the weekend turned violent. Some protesters ended up bloodied and the local sheriff said three private security officers had been hurt.) ”The Corps acknowledges that the public interest would be served by preserving peace near Lake Oahe until the Court can render its   opinion on Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction,” the Corps said. ”The Corps therefore does not oppose this short and discrete temporary restraining order.”"
2016-09-07," The president, as he prepared to leave office, was dead broke. So broke, in fact, that he had to take out a loan to get him through the transition. Bill Clinton in 2001? No, Harry Truman in 1953  —   and the resemblance ends there.  Back then, although Truman had only a monthly Army pension of $112. 56, he was adamant about not employing his presidential service to cash in. As biographer David McCullough relates, Truman turned down a new Toyota; a Miami real estate development company’s offer of “not less than $100, 000” to come on board; an array of consulting gigs.  “I could never lend myself to any transaction, however respectable, that would commercialize on the prestige and dignity of the office of the presidency,” Truman later wrote. Those were the days  —   and even then they weren’t, entirely. Months after leaving office, Truman sold the rights to his memoirs to Life magazine for $600, 000  —   the equivalent of more than $5 million today.  Still, the Truman ethos of not capitalizing on the office has all but dissipated. Gerald Ford avidly snapped up corporate board memberships and consulting fees. Ronald Reagan shattered presidential   records with $2 million from a Japanese company, prompting his successor, George H. W. Bush, to shrug, “Everybody’s got to make a living. ”  Indeed, out of office, both Bushes turned their attention to the need to “replenish the ol’ coffers,” as George W. Bush put it. But no one has filled the coffers so copiously, so quickly as Bill Clinton. “I was one poor rascal when I took office,” Clinton told a student group in 2009. “But after I got out, I made a lot of money. ” Actually, a   amount. Between the two of them, Bill and Hillary Clinton have reported earning more than $235 million since leaving the White House. An unsettling reminder of the gusher of cash that can flow a former president’s way came with a recent report in The Post on the $17. 6 million that Bill Clinton earned as a consultant and “honorary chancellor” from Laureate International Universities, a   college company. Compared with other former presidents, we know an enormous amount about the Clintons’   activities thanks to financial disclosure rules imposed on Hillary Clinton while in the Senate and the State Department, and to her voluntary decision to release tax returns, with their more detailed and precise contents, in her campaigns.  The simultaneity of Bill Clinton’s   with Hillary Clinton’s public service and, if she has her way,   poses particular problems about the intersection of his paychecks with her government work.  But the Clintons’ rapaciousness raises broader questions about what we should expect from our former presidents and about what has become former presidential   . That profiting to this extent from public service has become routine does not mean that we as a society should accept it as a given  —   and the grossness of the Clintons’ example ought to give rise to a reassessment. Lest this sound hopelessly naive, this long after the   horse has left the barn, a few specific suggestions: Let’s pay our   more from the public fisc (their annual pension is now about $200, 000) and expect more from them. In exchange for receiving the higher pension money, they could be required to file annual financial disclosure forms, just as they did while president. We can’t stop   from vacuuming up huge speaking fees, including from questionable sources, but we can force them to do it in sunlight, whose glare could be chastening.     Seven countries, including three Persian Gulf states, donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. (Bastien   Washington Post)   Alternatively, or in addition, make the pension dependent on forgoing outside income above a certain amount  —   as is already done in some cases for federal employees who go through the revolving door into lucrative jobs. Perhaps presidents could collect their pension only if they eschew income from any sources beyond writing books;   presidential memoirs have a long history (see Ulysses Grant) and serve the public interest more than   speeches. Finally, perhaps we could alter the expectations in advance by raising such questions before candidates are elected. Donald Trump has proposed asking senior officials to agree to refrain for five years from taking speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist or from entities tied to a foreign government. Why not at least ask   presidents if they would abide by that restriction, perhaps expanded to include consulting fees, and perhaps for life? If they’re not willing to give up the big bucks, do we really want to give them the big job?  Read more from Ruth Marcus’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.

2016-09-08," The biggest problem for me, as a reporter covering not just Donald Trump but Trumpism, has been how to explain the racial and cultural anxieties many Trump supporters feel without either excusing or dismissing them.    Sociologist Arlie Hochschild, who spent five years in conservative white rural Louisiana  —   the sort of communities that eventually became Trump Country  —   does just that in her interview with Vox’s Brad Plumer. You should read the whole interview. In particular, though, you should pay particular attention to the ”deep story” that, Hochschild says, explains how her subjects see the world:  Think of people waiting in a long line that stretches up a hill. And at the top of that is the American dream. And the people waiting in line felt like they’d worked extremely hard, sacrificed a lot, tried their best, and were waiting for something they deserved. And this line is increasingly not moving, or moving more slowly [i. e. as the economy stalls]. Then they see people cutting ahead of them in line. Immigrants, blacks, women, refugees,   workers. And even an   brown pelican getting priority. In their view, people are cutting ahead unfairly. And then in this narrative, there is Barack Obama, to the side, the line supervisor who seems to be waving these people (and the pelican) ahead. So the government seemed to be on the side of the people who were cutting in line and pushing the people in line back.  As Plumer points out, in economic terms this story isn’t true. But Hochschild counters that her subjects felt when they did struggle, ”there was no cultural sympathy for them.” If anything, there was a tendency to ”blame the categories of whiteness and maleness,” while cultural elites in the press and politics mocked their ”redneck” social class.    It is true, objectively, that the improvement of life prospects for women and nonwhites has not been  ; it is also true that a substantial percentage of people feel that something has been taken from them for the benefit of cultural others, and are pained by it.    For me this has been the hardest question to answer about the anger that has been awoken by Trumpism: What should     —   or, if you prefer, elites  —   say to people whose pain is rooted in the myth that they’ve been hurt by other groups’ gains, but is real and potent nonetheless?    Getting out of the ”racism versus economic anxiety” quagmire For the last year, there’s been a debate among people who are not supporters of Donald Trump about whether Trump supporters are more motivated by ”race” (which is to say, racism and racial anxieties) or economic anxieties. That debate’s often been frustrating. Most people are simply more willing to call others ”economically anxious” (something for which the blame lies with a government or market that has failed them) than to call them racist. This is why Hochschild’s formulation is so helpful: It’s a way to talk about the pain that people feel, sympathetically, without litigating the reasons they feel it.            As Hochschild tells it, there’s a gap between the measurable, objective reality of social status  —   like how well someone is doing economically  —   and the subjective reality of it: how people see themselves as fitting into the social world.    The fact that it’s a perception doesn’t make it any less real: People’s feelings about their ability to get ahead shape how they feel about their lives, how motivated they are to work hard, how prone to despair. But the other reason that the ”race versus economic anxiety” debate is frustrating is that while people bicker over where, exactly, the proportions of blame should be assigned, the things they’re really disagreeing about rest beneath the surface. It seems to me that the biggest disagreement isn’t really what is causing the pain of Trump supporters. It’s what the response of     —   the people having the ”race or anxiety” argument  —   should be to that pain. You could stubbornly insist the pain isn’t real, because it’s not justified by economic reality, or say that it’s their own fault for being racist. That would shut down the conversation; it would drive them deeper into the conviction that they’re locked in opposition against nonwhites and the elites who aid them. Or you could acknowledge that pain and try to fix it. But you’d have to find a way to do it without saying it’s okay to resent nonwhite people for making progress in America  —   without accepting the premise that one group’s gain is always another one’s loss. I have no idea which one of these approaches is correct; I haven’t been able to figure it out myself. But it seems to me that if even a fraction of the energy devoted to asking ”why Trump?” were devoted to asking ”what do we do next?” we might be able to crack the dilemma. And if we couldn’t  —   well, at very least we’d discover where the real, irreconcilable fault lines in American society are.  What the media gets wrong about Trump voters    "
2016-09-09,"Where is the party of simple human decency? Back in 2012, at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash. a    transgendered, biologically intact male named Colleen Francis insisted on undressing in front of a woman and girls as young as six years old in a pool locker room. “A second report filed by an outside swim coach stated having ‘observed Colleen sitting with her legs open with her male genitalia showing’ in the sauna. ” After a great deal of public outcry, the school came up with a solution: It curtained off a small area in the locker room for the little girls and worried women to use if they wanted. Ever since I read this story, I’ve wondered what would happen if Colleen Francis, or other transgendered biological males, had decided to go behind that curtain too. RELATED: President Obama’s Transgender Proclamation Is Far Broader and More Dangerous than You Think, Sounds like a hostile school environment to me, one that would certainly discourage girls from equal access to athletic activities as required by Title IX. So, how did the school handle the girls’ complaints? Officials told girls who were bothered that they could use a secondary locker room in the basement of the school. “Plaintiff B and nearly half the junior varsity squad changed in the secondary locker room,” according to the lawsuit. One plaintiff was told she could use a vacant boys’ basketball locker room for privacy. But then a transgender student “walked into the boys’ basketball locker room while Girl Plaintiff A was in her underwear and removed his pants while he was near her and other girls who were also changing,” the lawsuit states. “This incident deeply upset Girl Plaintiff A. It signaled to her that there was no place in the school where she could preserve her privacy under the new policy. ” (Hat tip to Todd Starnes for being the first to cover this important lawsuit.) RELATED: New Transgender Rules for Schools Are about Obama’s Culture War, A party of decency would provide a way for the transgender students to change or use a restroom with privacy. Decent people bend over backwards to try meet the needs of every student. But a party of decency would not decide that there is some fundamental right to expose yourself to the opposite sex in the name of transgender rights. A party of decency certainly would not tell every public school in America that it risks losing federal funding unless it invades girls’ privacy rights, as President Obama has done with Hillary Clinton’s endorsement. This issue is only a symptom, of course. A decent person would never look a grieving mother in the face and blatantly lie to her about why her son died, as Hillary Clinton did, or tell a naval officer it’s okay for her to mishandle classified documents in order to protect her own political future. A party of decency would not nominate a man such as Donald Trump, either. I could say I long for a party of principle, but what is missing in America right now is the party of decency. More Transgender Puberty Suppression and FGMYouTube’s New Father FigureChelsea Manning and the Problem with PronounsI think this is why I’m so unmoved by the idea pushed by the pseudonymous Publius Decius Mus, that in rallying around Trump we are somehow like the passengers who brought down Flight 93. They were decent men who gave their lives refusing to ally passively with evil. “If conservatives are right about the importance of virtue, morality, religious faith, stability, character and so on in the individual if they are right about sexual morality or what came to be termed ‘family values’ if they are right about the importance of education to inculcate good character and to teach the fundamentals that have defined knowledge in the West for millennia if they are right about societal norms and public order,” as Public Decius Mus writes, then we cannot be for Trump. Or Hillary, either.,"
2016-09-10,"   Michael Morell was acting director and deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2010 to 2013. Mike Vickers was the undersecretary of defense for intelligence from 2011 to 2015.  Both writers have served in Democratic and Republican administrations and endorsed Hillary Clinton for president.    Mr. Trump, with all due respect to you as the presidential nominee of the Republican Party, you cannot credibly serve as commander in chief if you embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader has repeatedly shown himself to be an adversary of the United States. Putin, during his long tenure, has repeatedly pursued policies that undermine U. S. interests and those of our allies and partners. He has steadily but systematically moved Russia from a fledgling democratic state to an authoritarian one. He is the last foreign leader you should be praising.  Abroad, Putin has interfered in the internal affairs of a host of nations on his periphery  —   through information operations, manipulation of elections and direct support, including providing weapons, to insurgent groups. Most significant, in the past decade, Putin has invaded two neighbors, Georgia and Ukraine  —   including annexing Crimea, the first major land grab in Europe since World War II. Putin’s goal in doing this is to keep the nations of the former Soviet Union from linking their futures to that of Europe and the West. Do you back these actions?  Putin’s support of insurgents in Eastern Ukraine resulted in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which killed 298 innocent civilians. Under Putin’s direction, Russian special forces provided the insurgents with the   system that brought down the plane; Russian special forces trained them on how to use it. As intelligence officers who oversaw covert action, we can tell you that when a country provides overt or covert support to proxies, that nation is responsible for what those proxies do with that support. That makes Putin responsible for downing the airliner. Do you hold him responsible?  Also abroad, Putin has aggressively supported Syrian President Bashar  ’s brutality against his own people. Putin’s significant intervention in Syria 12 months ago  —   via the Russian air force and Russian special forces  —   propped up Assad at the exact moment that the Syrian leader appeared to be losing his grip on power and might therefore be amenable to negotiating a transition of power. As such, Putin is in part responsible for the continuing civil war that has resulted in the deaths of 500, 000 Syrians and displaced 10 million others, the greatest humanitarian crisis since World War II. Do you support what Putin has done in Syria?      On Sept. 7, during a town hall event hosted by MSNBC, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stated he would have “a good relationship” with Russian president Vladimir Putin. It wasn’t the first time he’s been friendly towards him. (Adriana   Washington Post)   At home, Putin has jailed and killed political opponents. He has jailed and killed journalists. He has neutered the Russian media to the point that he is in complete control of the message reaching the Russian people. He has the popularity that you so admire only because he determines what the Russian people hear about him and his government. Do you support Putin’s violation of Russian law and his tramping of the civil rights of his populace, explicitly protected in the Russian constitution?  One of the more interesting questions is who is the biggest loser from Putin’s policies? Take Putin’s actions in Ukraine. One set of losers, of course, was the Ukrainian people, who had their aspirations crushed. Another was the West, particularly the United States, which looked impotent to stop the Russian aggression. But the biggest loser was the Russian people  —   because Putin has ended any hope of integrating the Russian economy with that of the West, Russia’s only hope for the future. Given this, do you still think Putin is a great leader?  At the    forum on Wednesday, you said that as long as Putin says nice things about you, you will say nice things about him. That is not a standard on which a candidate, or a president, should make policy decisions. That should not even enter your calculus. Your only question should be, “What is in the best interests of the United States?”  So, here is our challenge: Demand that Putin stop his aggressive behavior overseas. Demand that he stop his dictatorial moves at home. Tell him that you will live up to our NATO commitments and defend the Baltics, if need be. Tell him that you want to work with him on solving the problems in the world  —   but that he must behave in order to do so. That is what a true commander in chief would do.

Odell Beckham Jr. and Victor Cruz plan to wear special   cleats for today’s season opener.   —   SportsCenter (@SportsCenter)  Beckham’s special cleats were red, white and blue and emblazoned with the bust of a bald eagle.

His dad was a smokeater in Paterson, NJ, before his death in 2007. Tennessee Titans linebacker Avery Williamson also opted to wear     commemorative cleats in his team’s game against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. After Williamson announced last week that he would be wearing the cleats, the NFL  —   notorious for conformity  —   informed players they would be fined if they didn’t wear the league’s white regulation shoes. The fine for a first offense is $6, 076. 00. Multiple unions leaders said Saturday they would pick up the check if Williamson opted to wear his specially designed cleats."
2016-09-12," WE ARE not worried that Hillary Clinton is, as she jokingly put it on Jimmy Kimmel’s show last month, “on the brink. ” Pneumonia can be a serious condition, but it is generally treatable, and Ms. Clinton appears to be getting good care. Even a   would struggle to stay perfectly healthy on Ms. Clinton’s grueling campaign schedule. We are instead worried about what we might not know about each   presidential candidate’s health  —   concerns that both of them have encouraged by a lack of transparency.  Both campaigns are now promising to be more forthcoming. They need to be much more so.  Following a pneumonia diagnosis that went undisclosed for multiple days, Ms. Clinton has received the brunt of the criticism on medical disclosure. To a degree, this has been  . First she hid her diagnosis, attempting to press on as though nothing were wrong. Then, when this decision got the best of her, she hastily left an event and kept the public in the dark about her condition for part of Sunday afternoon, fueling founded and unfounded speculations. A bout of pneumonia is not a major story; she could have taken some of the air out of the hysteria if she had been more open in the first place.  It is important not to get lost in the specifics of this episode and lose sight of the bigger picture. Donald Trump and his circle have encouraged dark conspiracy theories about Ms. Clinton’s health. Yet, at 70, Mr. Trump is the older of the two. In fact, he would be the oldest person ever elected to the presidency. Ms. Clinton has at least revealed some specifics about her medical history, releasing a doctor’s letter last year describing previous medical events and current conditions that appear to be under control. Mr. Trump, by contrast, has released nothing more than an absurd gastroenterologist’s note that is so short on specifics and long on hyperbole that it sounds like Mr. Trump could have written it himself. Perversely, Mr. Trump may now benefit from concerns over the candidates’ health.  Both need to do better. Sen. John McCain ( .) who was 71 when he ran for president in 2008, released nearly 1, 200 pages of medical records. He did not do this to feed pure voyeurism. He did it so that voters could evaluate their comfort with the health of a septuagenarian applying for the toughest job in the world  —   in which there are no sick days and a slip of the tongue can become an international incident. Neither Ms. Clinton, who is 68, nor Mr. Trump have come close to this level of disclosure.  The campaigns promised Monday to release more information. We will believe them when we see the documents. Mr. Trump, in particular, promised to disclose official forms before  —   his tax returns  —   and has since offered bogus excuses for not doing so. The candidates must do more than simply reveal a few current   numbers. They should provide historical documents reflecting examinations not conducted in the midst of a presidential campaign. The goal must be to assure voters that they have disclosed anything that could hinder them while in office or create a risk that they could not serve a full term.

2016-09-13,"Any player or coach for high school sports teams in the diocese who does not “demonstrate appropriate respect” during the   Banner will be subject to a   suspension, Philly. com reports. Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a   for Conservatives! The Catholics are doing what the National Football League refuses to do. “Our schools are founded on the teaching of respect and honor respect and honor for God, country and duly appointed authority,” Supt. Mary Boyle wrote to Catholic high schools in the diocese. “The best approach is helping our young people understand that blood was sacrificed so that we all can enjoy the gifts of our faith and our country. ” Players, coaches and administrators are expected to show respect during prayer, pledges and the playing of the national anthem, she declared. “Failure to demonstrate appropriate respect will result in suspension from play (2 games) or dismissal from the team for subsequent offense,” she wrote. Bishop Eustace’s football team requires young men to stand at attention. “Helmet under left arm. Stand straight. Chest out. Eyes ahead,” assistant athletic director Frank DelRossi told the newspaper. “We think it’s important, and our kids do too. ” The Catholics don’t mess around, folks. In recent days    many professional football players have demonstrated contempt for the Armed Forces as well as our national anthem. The disgraceful trend was started by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kapernick  —   who refused to stand as a way of protesting perceived racial oppression and inequality. Mr. Kaepernick is a   unpatriotic dunderhead. But to be fair    it’s hard for a football player to stand up for America when he’s got his head up his hindquarters. To be clear    professional football players have a Constitutional right to demonstrate their hatred of America. They have a right to denigrate our troops and desecrate the flag. But we have rights, too. We have the right to boycott their games along with the corporate sponsors who finance their   platforms. Eli Harold, a 49ers teammate who raised his fist in defiance of our nation, told ESPN he was furious that fans objected to the protest. “What really pissed me off was when Kap was getting snaps at the end of the game and the crowd was booing,” he told ESPN. “I’m not throwing shots at our fans. It’s not about that. Liberty and justice for all. Just because this man is standing up for something he believes in doesn’t give you the right to boo him. I just don’t understand it, man. I really don’t. ” Eli Harold, you dolt, it’s called the First Amendment. Fans most certainly do have the right to boo and heckle and boycott. Now you understand why so many people are disgusted with the National Football League. And that’s why it was so refreshing to hear about the edict handed down by the Diocese of Camden. They are teaching young men to be patriots    men of honor and duty. It’s instruction that’s badly needed in the National Football League. Maybe the diocese could send a delegation of nuns to the next 49ers game    armed with rulers. Todd Starnes is host of Fox News  Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

Please follow the steps below, If you spend even a day or two in Eastport, Maine, at least one of its proud residents will probably lead you to the water’s edge and point across Passamaquoddy Bay to Campobello Island and the summer home of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The house has a green roof and a broad lawn sweeping down to the water. It is where FDR was struck down with polio in 1921. During our most recent visit to Eastport for our American Futures project, we finally got to visit Campobello. We also discovered a few surprising things about how the Roosevelts’ transit through downeast Maine by train and ferry to Campobello affected our American Futures project a good 80 years later. In 1920, when FDR was waging a failed run as   running mate to nominee James Cox, he stopped in Eastport to give a speech. He also endorsed the design of a young engineer who proposed a way to harness the power of the Passamaquoddy Bay tides to generate electricity. In 1935, the controversial project eventually received seven million dollars from FDR’s administration under Public Works Administration funding. This built two dams, a navigation lock, a gate, a generating station and a small residential area called Quoddy Village for the workers and their families. All this effort was extremely   Congress blocked further funding for the project, and work halted in the summer of 1936. Everyone moved out of Quoddy Village. (The idea for harnessing tidal power was a great one, however, and it has returned in promising and now   form. Jim wrote about it here.) In 1937, Quoddy Village was turned over to the National Youth Administration (NYA) a   project to provide vocational training and work experience for some of the vast population of underemployed   youth. The effort in Eastport was called the Quoddy Regional Project and described as “an experiment in youth rehabilitation. ” Over the next seven years, the comprehensive project accepted groups of hundreds of young men in their late teens to mid 20s from needy New England families. For at least five months at a time, the young men were oriented, trained, given work assignments, and evaluated. They brushed up on their English and math skills. The project looked after their medical and dental care and their recreation, including sports, dances, and movies. They had library time, put out a paper called the Quoddy Eagle, took citizenship classes, and elected a mayor and council for their Quoddy Village government. They lived     in two Quoddy Village dorms, which had been built for   workers. They ate plentiful, healthy food. As noted in a very poignant description in the 1940 report was “an almost immediate gain in weight on the part of the great majority of junior personnel. ” Eleanor Roosevelt, an enthusiastic supporter of the NYA took the ferry from Campobello to visit Quoddy Village in 1941, and wrote this report as one of her regular columns for the Boston American: We are having the most wonderful weather   …     Yesterday morning, on the water, it was cool and we had a grand breeze on our way over to Eastport. Once landed there, we took a taxi and went out to Quoddy Village to visit the NYA resident project. I had not seen this project since it had been turned over to the boys. I was impressed by the excellence of the work shops and by the tremendous interest which the boys show in the work they are doing in aviation mechanics and the regular machine shops. They have good classrooms and have set up an instrument room now, because they found a demand for men who could work on instruments. The gliders they are making are extraordinarily good, and I hope the Army will send somebody up to inspect them, because I feel they could be used for experimental purposes. an airfield is being built quite nearby, so that some day they will actually see their engines take a plane off the grounds, we hope. Perhaps the most exciting part of this project is the actual practice of democracy. The law allows no discrimination of race or religion, and these boys have entered into the spirit of real democracy. Since they govern themselves, they see to it that no discrimination exists. They have a mayor, a council and a court. They also hold elections   …    . I saw them have dinner. The food is good and yet they do it on 38 cents per boy per day. They plan a full recreational program and seem interested and happy. I think the NYA project at Quoddy is a very valuable project, for it seems to be turning out good men. I was struck in a     way by one comment Eleanor wrote: We took a taxi and went out to Quoddy Village. There were taxis in Eastport! The first lady took a taxi! Today, the taxis are long gone from Eastport no Uber there yet either. To get around during our visits, we relied on the goodwill of local residents to give us a ride or lend us a car, which they readily did with   generosity. *  *  * The work opportunities for the NYA youth were vast and varied. Interestingly, many of the   version of skills training are replicated in the many, many programs we have seen across the U. S. in the progressive community colleges and technical training high schools today. Some of the names and certainly the technology have changed. There was cafeteria work (now called culinary skills) carpentry, drafting and planning, and woodworking (which now includes   technology) electrical work garage work (now called automotive training) medical services sheet metal and aviation work, including construction and maintenance of airplanes. And much more. By the late 1930s, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) had begun building airports around Maine as a national defense move. With Eastport’s Quoddy Village aviation work and its strategic downeast location, it was natural that Eastport would be a candidate for an airport. In 1941, construction began. The first runway, 3, 000 feet long and running northeast to southwest, is now 4, 000 feet long and where we landed on all our visits to Eastport. The first time we tried to land, we had to abort and circle because a man on his mowing tractor was using the runway and didn’t hear us coming. We finally got his attention. The second   runway was never finished, but its vestigial limb remains the   to airplane parking today. In early 1943, NYA suddenly lost its funding, Quoddy Village closed up again, and everyone was gone within three weeks. It became home for a while to Navy Seabees. During our last visit, we drove the mile or two to the outskirts of town to have a look at the Quoddy Village of today. Many of the 123 houses are still standing, and better yet, many have been renovated. We found it surprisingly evocative to walk through the streets, imagining the eras that have come before and passed away. The dorms are vacant. The warehouses are vacant. There is no library anymore. But it feels like another second wind, actually the fourth wind, has arrived. Selfishly speaking, without FDR and the WPA, without Eleanor and the NYA, there would likely have been no airport built. And we probably wouldn’t have made it to Eastport. At the end of our last visit, we put in our request for an upgrade to the field: There is a weather station, but it is not connected to any transmitting capability. Without weather data, we looked in vain for the (faded) weather sock, and we had to scour the skies for the direction of blowing smoke, or flags, or trees swaying in the wind. So, our one request to Eastport: Please activate the weather station!"
2016-09-15,"Donald Trump is lashing out against an   pastor who interrupted him Wednesday to chide him for campaigning in her Flint, Mich. church. ”Something was up,” Trump told Fox and Friends on Thursday morning, calling the Rev. Faith Green Timmons a ”nervous mess.” ”I noticed she was so nervous when she introduced me,” he said. ”When she got up to introduce me she was so nervous, she was shaking. I said, wow, this is kind of strange. Then she came up. So she had that in mind, there’s no question.” That was preceded, as Politico reported, by one of the show’s hosts, Steve Doocy, referencing a Facebook post on Timmons’ page that read, ”HE WILL NOT USE US, WE will EDUCATE HIM! !!” Doocy asked if he thought ”they were out to sabotage you.” (That post no longer appears on Timmons’ page.) Recently, Trump has been trying to reach out to black voters. At an event this month at a black church in Detroit, for example, Trump said, ”I’m here today to learn. . .. ” That more humble tone came after his   characterizations  —   before mostly white crowds  —   of black communities as having schools that are ”no good,” that ”you have no jobs,” so, ”What the hell do you have to lose?” I was in the room in Flint as a pool reporter at the time, and here’s what happened: Trump visited Bethel United Methodist Church on Wednesday afternoon after briefly touring Flint’s water treatment plant. (Flint has become a   campaign stop this year because of its   water quality crisis.) The Rev. Timmons introduced Trump to the predominantly   crowd of about 50 people, and she didn’t appear nervous at all. Trump began his brief speech with a joke. ”It used to be cars were made in Flint, and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. Now the cars are made in Mexico, and you can’t drink the water in Flint.” After that, Trump shifted into a version of his   stump speech, blasting   deals like NAFTA and pointing out that   Clinton completed the international trade deal. As Trump began to criticize his opponent, Hillary Clinton, Timmons slowly walked back onto the stage. ”Mr. Trump, I invited you here to thank us for what we’ve done for Flint, not to give a political speech,” she said. ”Oh, oh, OK, OK, OK. That’s good,” Trump said. ”Then I’m going to go back onto Flint, OK.” ”The audience was saying, ’Let him speak, let him speak,’ ” Trump told Fox and Friends. That isn’t true. In fact, several audience members began to heckle Trump, asking pointed questions about whether he racially discriminated against black tenants as a landlord. And that’s when Timmons  —   who Trump said Thursday had planned to ambush him  —   stepped in to defend Trump, saying the Republican nominee was ”a guest of my church, and you will respect him.” ”Thank you. Thank you, Pastor,” Trump responded. The pointed questions for Trump continued as he wrapped up his remarks, though  —   and that’s the moment when the press traveling with Trump were hastily escorted out of the room. Wednesday night, Timmons was back on Facebook. ”Had he stuck to what his camp claimed he came to do,” she wrote, ”we would not have had a problem!   Good night.”"
2016-09-16," Donald Trump’s campaign said late Thursday the Republican presidential nominee believes President Obama was born in the United States, after he earlier refused to answer the question in a Washington Post interview. The candidate has for years repeatedly implied or added fuel to discredited conspiracy theories that Obama wasn’t actually born in Hawaii, and he refused to directly answer whether he believes the president was born in the US in an interview published Thursday. “I’ll answer that question at the right time. I just don’t want to answer it yet,” Trump told the paper. Hours later, in an apparent effort at damage control, Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller released a statement saying, “Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States. ” In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. Inarguably, Donald J. Trump is a closer. Having successfully obtained President Obama’s birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States. Mr. Trump is now totally focused on bringing jobs back to America, defeating radical Islamic terrorism, taking care of our veterans, introducing school choice opportunities and rebuilding and making our inner cities safe again. Last week his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN that Trump “believes President Obama was born here,” following similar comments made by New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. When asked about Conway’s comments, Trump said: “It’s OK. She’s allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on other things. ” But pressed on the issue, Trump told the Post: “I don’t talk about it anymore. The reason I don’t is because then everyone is going to be talking about it as opposed to jobs, the military, the vets, security. ” Obama released his Hawaii birth certificate in 2011, but Trump has never renounced his birther position. An ’extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that @BarackObama’s birth certificate is a fraud. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton immediately seized on Trump’s comments doubting Obama’s birthplace Thursday night, telling the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Dinner: “And he still wouldn’t say Hawaii. He still wouldn’t say America  …     When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry? Now he’s tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is. ” She later tweeted about the comments, saying, “President Obama’s successor cannot and will not be the man who led the racist birther movement. Period. ” On Wednesday, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence said in an interview that Trump no longer questions Obama’s citizenship. “Those are issues of the past,” Pence said. “Donald Trump and I both accept that the president was born in the United States of America. ” Despite the campaign statement Thursday, Trump himself has not said Obama was born in the US. “Trump needs to say it himself. On camera,” Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted. Trump needs to say it himself. On camera. And admit he was wrong for trying to delegitimize the country’s first African American President,    "
2016-09-17," Five years of crushing drought has turned water into one of the most contentious issues facing California. And now, a plan to divert millions of gallons of water away from cities and agriculture is promising to make the state’s water wars even more explosive. The battle surrounds fresh water flowing down the San Joaquin River, a major waterway that runs through California’s Central Valley, before reaching the San Francisco Bay. Right now, 20% or less of the river water is allowed to flow unimpaired into the ocean. The rest is dammed, stored, and diverted for use by people in farms and cities. On Thursday, however, the State Water Resources Control Board  —   the regulators who oversee California’s complicated water system  —   rolled out a plan that would mandate 40% of the water in the river flow to the ocean, doubling the current rate. The reasoning: allowing more water to flow out will help bolster threatened fish populations, including salmon and steelhead. The proposal, while not finalized yet, is sparking outrage in the Central Valley. “It’s just so preposterous,” said Deidre Kelsey, a Merced County supervisor. “It can’t work. Unless everybody picks and moves out of the valley. ” Merced County is one of several largely rural counties in central California that largely survives on its access to water. In an interview with BuzzFeed News late Thursday, Kelsey said she was “kind of aghast” and called the plan “not sensible in the least. ” The problems, Kelsey argued, are complex and far ranging. Sending more water into the ocean leaves farmers and communities with less, of course, but it also means ground water reserves don’t get refilled as often, which otherwise happens when the water people use seeps into subterranean aquifers. A reduction, Kelsey said, consequently hits the region on two fronts. “I don’t think that this would have happened had we been a more urban part of California,” she added. “We’re not the Bay Area. We’re not LA. We’re easy pickings. ” Daron McDaniel, another Merced County supervisor, said ground water reserves are already dangerously low, causing certain parts of the county to literally sink. Like Kelsey, he also blasted the proposal to send more water out to sea. “It’s killing the valley,” he said. “It’s very frustrating for us who are living here at ground zero. ” The anger is widespread and local officials throughout the region have condemned the proposal. California assemblyman Adam Gray, for example, described it as an “economic death sentence,” and Jake Wenger of the Modesto Irrigation District told KQED the move amounts to “an all out assault” on the community. But not everyone is up in arms. In a statement Wednesday, Golden Gate Salmon Association executive director John McManus called the move “a historic step to right a wrong. ” McManus characterized the proposal as “leaving a bit more water” in the river, and said California has long been diverting too much water for human consumption. “California was a natural paradise until we killed much of it by unwise development and the extreme water diversions on the San Joaquin River and its tributaries are prime evidence,” McManus said. Other conservationists said the new proposal doesn’t go far enough and argued even more water should be sent downstream. In a post Wednesday, Doug Obegi of the Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote that the proposal “falls short of what the science shows is needed to protect and restore the health of these rivers and their native salmon. ” “Depriving these rivers of the flows that the science says is necessary to keep them healthy is not a ‘balanced’ approach,” Obegi added, “it is simply a continuing failure to grapple with our   system. ” The two sides disagree not just on how the water should be diverted, but on whether increasing the flow in the river will even help the fish in the first place. According to McManus, damming the river already drove one fish species to extinction and sending more water down river will provide “a chance to at least save some of the salmon that still survive. ” State Water Resources Control Board spokesman Tim Moran told BuzzFeed News “science says to ideally help the fish it’d be 60%” unimpaired flows, but said regulators chose a lower number  —   the agency describes 40% as a “starting point,” and also recommends a range between 30% and 50%  —   as a compromise. “We know that its going to hurt but we’re searching for a balance,” he said. All the local officials who spoke with BuzzFeed News, however, rejected the argument that increased flows will actually help, saying instead that the fish are threatened by other factors such as predators. “We know the unimpaired flows aren’t working to help out the salmon, we know it’s a predation issue,” McDaniel argued. “We can’t just continue to send water down the river hoping it’s going to work, because we know it’s not going to work. ” McManus countered that predators are able to pick juvenile fish off more easily when flows are low, and that increasing the water in the river would help address that problem as well. Whatever happens, the brewing fight will have   affects. Stanislaus County Supervisor Terry Withrow told BuzzFeed News the plan could affect thousands of jobs and force growers to leave more than 200, 000 acres of farmland unplanted. He also estimated the costs to the region at half a billion dollars. “Its going to be devastating,” he said. The consequences will be far ranging, impacting food supplies and prices far beyond California, Withrow said. “People don’t appreciate where the food comes from here,” he said. “We feed the world. ” The California Farm Bureau Federation seconded Withrow’s take in a statement to BuzzFeed News, saying 240, 000 acres could be fallowed. The economic impacts could be far reaching as well, the CFBF added. “Forcing farmland to be fallowed —  as this proposal would surely do —  degrades the unique environmental resource represented by California farmland, and will hurt people and the economy throughout the region and state,” CFBF President Paul Wenger said. McManus agreed that changing the flows will have an economic impact, but said years of bad decisions and poor planning have given rise to “communities and economies and industries have all evolved to take advantage of relaxed water regulation. ” “Through poor choices through recent history, I would argue that too much water was basically given away,” he said. A final decision on the plan won’t come until next year, after a   public comment period. Moran said that his agency will hold public meetings and then make a final decision based on the input it receives. And if fish populations recover, more water might be set aside for human use. “Ideally they’ll respond very well,” Moran said of the fish, “and we won’t have to increase flows. But who knows. ” In the mean time, the case shows how water in the nation’s most populous state is only become more of a flash point as the   drought drags on, population increases, and appetite for California crops grows. And locals aren’t willing to wait and see what happens. The county supervisors speculated that the months and years ahead will be filled with legal wrangling and battles against what they described as an extreme plan that will decimate their region. “Extremes turn into nothing but war, and that’s what this is going to turn into,” Withrow said. “A legal battle. ”  "
2016-09-18," An Iranian cyclist died Saturday from an injury sustained during a road race at the Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Golbarnezhad, 48, crashed around 10:40 a. m. local time during the first section of the C4 cycling road race, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said in a statement. “The athlete received treatment at the scene and was in the process of being taken to the athlete hospital when he suffered a cardiac arrest,” the IPC said. “The ambulance then diverted to the nearby Unimed Rio Hospital in Barra where he passed away soon after arrival. ” Both the athlete’s family in Iran, and the Iranian Paralympic team in Rio, were subsequently informed of his death. The Iranian flag has since been lowered to   in the Paralympic Village as a sign of respect. The Paralympic flag will also be lowered in the village and a moment of silence will also be held during Sunday’s closing ceremony. “This is truly   news and the thoughts and condolences of the whole Paralympic Movement are with Bahman’s family, friends, and teammates as well as the whole of the National Paralympic Committee of Iran,” IPC President Sir Philip Carven said. Officials are now investigating the circumstances of the accident. Sunday’s race was Golbarnezhad’s second event at the Rio Games, after he competed Wednesday in the C4 time trial, finishing 14th. A C4 race is a competitive class for “an athlete with a below knee amputation and a prosthesis on one leg,” according to the IPC’s guide to Paralympic classification. Golbarnezhad also competed in the 2012 Paralympics in London. “This is very sad news for sport and for the Paralympic movement,” said Carlos Nuzman, President of Rio 2016. “Our hearts and prayers are with Bahman’s family, his teammates, and all the people of Iran. ”  "
2016-09-19,"“I don’t want to be the first person to mention the name,” said the writer Moustafa Bayoumi as he brought up Donald Trump during the Terror, Threats and Fear panel at the Brooklyn book festival on Sunday, attributing the resurgence of   fringe groups to the rise of the Republican candidate. In this context, he said, he preferred the term “Trumpism, rather than Trump”. Bayoumi, author of This Muslim American Life, shared the panel with Amitava Kumar, author of A Foreigner Carrying in the Crook of His Arm a Tiny Bomb, and Masha Gessen, whose book The Brothers, about the Boston Marathon bombers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, provided the subject matter for much of the talk.  “It’s impossible to predict the roots of an act of violence,” said Gessen, as the panelists questioned the value of a “theatre of protection” if they impeded personal liberties and spoke of an “economy of terror” in which informants and terror suspects with “no other recourse to wealth” sought to transcend their financial destinies. Easy solutions were not offered, but a throwaway comment by Gessen seemed to point towards a troubling universal cause. “Nobody is going to blow people up if they’ve had a great life,” she said. Bayoumi would have been pleased to learn that he was neither the first to mention Trump, nor the first to wish he didn’t have to. During the earlier,   panel The Whole World is Watching, journalist Sarah Jaffe lamented the things “going on in the world that we don’t see, because we’re busy hanging on every word Trump says”. Meanwhile, Mychal Denzel Smith noted that for Trump’s supporters, “democracy is in full force” while the left wing of US politics had “seen what happened on the right and panicked back to the centre”. Still, the Nation’s Sarah Leonard offered hope to despondent Bernie fans. “These movements come in waves, they cascade,” she said, “There will be others [after Bernie Sanders] don’t panic. ” Panic was hardly in the air. But in the context of the looming election, it is no surprise that the festival’s speakers described an America that is riddled with anxieties. These ranged from the collective, with issues like war, recession and clashing communities stirring up insecurities, guilt and fear, to the personal. In one panel, American Angst and Anxiety, Emma Straub covered teenage angst  —   “the purest angst of all”  —   with a reading from her novel Modern Lovers, in which Ruby, “a black Jew with lesbian moms” rages against her situation with considerable solipsism. Elsewhere in the book, she told us, a   couple’s angst stemmed from unfulfilled creative ambition, though they lived a life with “all the trappings of success”. This talk of an artist’s ambition contrasted with Helen Ellis’s confession that, despite critical acclaim for her story collection The American Housewife, she had no desire to be considered a writer. Instead, she said, she channeled her daily experience of a housewife’s ennui into her characters, trapping them in “gilded cages” in which they could entertain themselves with mischief. These perspectives led the charge for the   New York experience, with its accompanying existential niggles, while a panel led by the podcast Lit Up’s Angela Ledgerwood dug deeper into family life, as Gayle Forman described a mother’s decision, in her novel Leave Me, to break the ultimate taboo and abandon her family.  Ledgerwood’s panel guests included Ali Eteraz, whose Native Believer returned my mind to a prevailing theme of the day  —   the Muslim experience in America. In Native Believer, M is a secular Muslim who is fired from his job for nebulous reasons, which we suspect are related to his heritage. Despite his own belief that he is living in “  America” M is unable to escape from prejudices formed without his participation, in part due to the ongoing war on terror.  This is an experience that came up repeatedly from other sources in panels throughout the day. The children’s writer, Jeanette Winters, spoke about calls to ban her book The Library of Basra in Florida schools because of its depiction of a child praying to Allah, and its inclusion of the phrase “inshallah”. The transformation of individuals to faceless symbols during the 15 years since September 11 was also encapsulated poignantly in a metaphor by the artist Molly Crabapple, who spoke about her experiences drawing prisoners in Guantánamo Bay. “They have been turned into orange jumpsuits,” she said, “who can be attached to whoever the US is currently at war with. ” The festival took place less than 24 hours after Saturday’s explosion in Chelsea, and before any details emerged of what it was. Although it was perfunctorily raised at the start of the Terror, Threats and Fear panel, the explosion was a   elsewhere. That was a testament to the fabled resilience of New Yorkers and to the unwillingness of the festival’s attendees and performers to jump to quick conclusions. Instead, they focused on a shared love of words and discourse.  Nowhere was the powerful draw of literature more visible than in the   queue around the St Francis College Auditorium, ahead of a highly anticipated conversation with Margaret Atwood. Over the course of an hour, the beloved author of The Handmaid’s Tale and the MaddAddam trilogy entertained her fans. She also discussed her latest work, a graphic novel called Angel Catbird, which features a superhero character with an “identity crisis” along with helpful tips on how to look after your cat.  “There’s a lot of cat puns in this book, I apologise,” said Atwood, who seems to have a permanent twinkle in her eye.  Atwood’s final thought was with the Future Library, the public art project to which she has contributed a story, to be read for the first time in 2114. There is an inherent optimism coded into this project, as in her answer to a question, from founder Katie Paterson, about artistic forms she has yet to try: “Maybe there is some medium that is yet uninvented that I will explore. ” For the worries of the near future, however, she had a simple solution. “Canada is not big enough to come to the rescue,” she said, “But you’re all welcome. We’ll set up cots. ”"
2016-09-20,"A Muslim migrant in Spain has gone on trial, accused of murdering with a “religious motivation” six Christian refugees, including a pastor, on a voyage across the Mediterranean from Africa to Europe. [The Cameroonian captain of the boat is thought to have beaten the Christians with a wooden plank before forcing them overbored, condemning them to certain death, because they were saying catholic prayers.  The Nigerian pastor was subjected to horrific abuse before he drowned, the public prosecutor wrote before the start of the trial in Almería,   Spain. “They badly wounded him before throwing him overboard” the prosecutor said, according to the Telegraph. The Muslims are even thought to have humiliated the Christians migrants, stealing their money and attempting to strip them of all Christian iconography and symbols. The Cameroonians captain and his deputy were found to be carrying €1, 500 in cash, the same amount witnesses said had been on their victims before the killings. Multiple witnesses, who also made the 2014 crossing from Morocco to the southern shore of Spain, described how the Muslims believed a storm had been caused by the Christian’s prays. Around 29 of the 50 migrants who survived the journey said the Muslim had “blamed the rough seas which were rocking the boat on the prayers led by a Catholic pastor on board” the Telegraph reports. At least 21 people perished during the disastrous crossing, but only one body washed ashore. The witnesses said that the captain’s second in command on the small boat “believed that the weather worsened every time the victims prayed”. However, he has died since arriving in Spain two years ago. According to the prosecution, the Muslim captain “was aware that the victims could not possibly survive and that they would die, either by drowning, from the cold, or from the physical injuries they had suffered. “He was aware of the low temperature, the rough seas and the great distance from the coast and the absence of any nearby boats which could rescue them”. The prosecutor has asked for six separate terms of 15 years for murder with the aggravating factor of “religious motivation” amounting to a   sentence. A similar case of a “religious massacre” occurred during a migrant crossing from Libya to Italy in April last year. Fifteen Muslims migrants were arrested after arriving in Sicily for allegedly murdering 12 Christians and throwing their corpses into the sea."
2016-09-21,"           For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, In a mostly expected move on Wednesday, the U. S. Federal Reserve decided not to raise interest rates at the September meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The committee’s   meeting concluded with Fed officials voting to keep the U. S. central bank’s target range for the federal funds rate at 0. 25 to 0. 5 percent. The Fed has yet to raise interest rates in 2016, and there are only two FOMC meetings left before the end of the year. The FOMC raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade last December. In a statement, the Fed said the FOMC determined that “the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. ” The Fed has two objectives when it makes its   decisions: reaching full employment and achieving an inflation rate of 2 percent. These two goals promote a strong economy and keep prices stable. And while the U. S.’s employment numbers have been strong in 2016, inflation remains low at 1. 6 percent. At a press conference following the decision, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen explained the committee’s reasoning for its “cautious approach”: So why didn’t we raise the federal funds rate at today’s meeting? Our decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy. Conditions in the labor market are strengthening, and we expect that to continue. And while inflation remains low, we expect it to rise to our 2 percent objective over time. But with labor market slack being taken up at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years, scope for some further improvement in the labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target, we chose to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives. The question now —  really, it’s one that’s been relevant for many months —  is when the conditions will finally be right for the Fed to raise rates. Expectations matter when it comes to Fed decisions, because monetary policy changes the cost and availability of money —  something that affects anyone who is a participant in the U. S. economy. Though the Fed weighs many factors regarding the domestic and global economy in its   decisions, the committee’s moving goal posts have economists and analysts wondering what it will take for a rate hike to happen. The Fed’s updated projections can be read as a signal that there’s still going to be a rate hike in 2016: Fourteen of 17 FOMC members expect at least one before the end of the year. The median of committee members’ predictions is that the federal funds rate will be 0. 625 by the end of 2016 —  which would mean one   increase this year, in either November or December at the FOMC’s upcoming meetings. If there’s a rate hike coming, it will be up to the Fed to realign the market’s expectations."
2016-09-22,"  A female Tulsa police officer was charged with   manslaughter Thursday in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man. Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler filed the charge against Officer Betty Shelby after viewing dashcam video and helicopter video of the Sept. 16 shooting, according to a statement from his office. The statement said Kunzweiler reviewed 911 calls, witness interviews and other information before making the decision to charge Shelby. Kunzweiler said arrangements were being made for Shelby’s surrender. ”I do not know why things happen in this world the way they do,” Kunzweiler said, adding that he determined   manslaughter the appropriate charge. ”We need to pray for wisdom and guidance.” Video from the shooting and its aftermath showed Crutcher walking away from Shelby with his arms in the air. The footage does not offer a clear view of when Shelby fired the single shot that killed Crutcher. Her attorney has said Crutcher was not following police commands and that Shelby opened fire when the man began to reach into his SUV window. Crutcher’s family immediately discounted that claim, saying the father of four posed no threat to the officers, while also pointing to an enlarged photo from police footage that appears to show Crutcher’s window was rolled up. Police have said Crutcher did not have gun on him or in his vehicle. ”The tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Crutcher are on the hearts and minds of many people in this community,” Kunzweiler said. ”It’s important to note that despite the heightened tensions felt by all, which seemingly beg for an emotional response and reaction, our community has consistently demonstrated the willingness to respect the judicial process. Among the definitions in Oklahoma for   manslaughter is a killing ”perpetrated unnecessarily either while resisting an attempt by the person killed to commit a crime, or after such attempt shall have failed.” ”We are happy that charges were brought, but let me be clear, the family wants and deserves full justice,” said Solomon Simmons, the family’s attorney.  ”Never lose sight of these cases,” he added. ”It’s not about hashtags, it’s about people.”  If convicted, Shelby could face a minimum of four years in prison. Shelby, who joined the Tulsa Police Department in December 2011, was on her way to a domestic violence call when she encountered Crutcher’s vehicle abandoned on a city street, straddling the center line. Shelby did not activate her patrol car’s dashboard camera, officials said, so no footage exists of what first happened between the two before other officers arrived. The police footage shows Crutcher approaching the driver’s side of the SUV, then more officers walk up and Crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle. A man inside a police helicopter overhead says: ”That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something.” The officers surround Crutcher and he suddenly drops to the ground. A voice heard on police radio says: ”Shots fired!” The officers back away and Crutcher is left unattended on the street for about two minutes before an officer puts on medical gloves and begins to attend to him. Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett said police worked quickly to provide Kunzweiler with the information he needed to decide whether to charge the officer. ”I appreciate their efforts as well as the District Attorney’s usual thorough evaluation of the rules of law for which we are all accountable,” Bartlett said in a written statement. ”These are important steps to ensure that justice and accountability prevails. ”We will continue to be transparent and ensure the system carries out its responsibility to provide justice.” Earlier this year, a former volunteer deputy with the Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of   manslaughter in the shooting death of Eric Harris. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
2016-09-23,"In a remarkable 2003 speech delivered to Yale University, former President Bill Clinton called for the establishment of a “global community,” praised the “openness of our borders to immigrants,” and declared that America “has greater obligations to open our borders. ”[In his address, Clinton plainly articulated his worldview and laid out his vision for the future. Clinton argued that the world currently relates to itself as “interdependent nations,” but that this model of interdependence lacks sufficient “integration. ” Clinton declared that he considers the formation a “genuine global community” —  complete with an “  system” to regulate it —  to be “the great mission of the 21st century. ”  “I think the great mission of the 21st century is to create a genuine global community, to move from mere interdependence to integration, to a community that has shared responsibilities, shared benefits and shared values. How would we go about building that kind of world?” he said. “We cannot continue to live in a world where we grow more and more interdependent and have no   system to make the positive elements of interdependence outweigh the negative ones. ” During his address, Clinton sang the praises of globalization, and, in particular, the “openness of our borders. ” “Many people today refer to the time in which we live as the age of globalization, and for most Americans, it has brought enormous benefits,” Clinton said. “Our country’s enormous increase in productivity was in no small part fueled by  …     the openness of our borders to immigrants who continued to replenish the energy of our entrepreneurial system. ” Clinton described “open borders” and “easy immigration” as two of the “forces of interdependence” —  forces, which Clinton suggests, are an essential part of creating a global community. However, Clinton admitted that these “forces of interdependence” come with certain risks, and he acknowledged that the   terrorists had exploited America’s “open borders” for their advantage. “On Sept. 11, 2001, Al Qaeda terrorists used the forces of interdependence —  open borders, easy travel, easy immigration, easy access to information and technology —  to turn jet airplanes full of fuel into weapons of mass destruction, killing 3, 100 people including hundreds from 70 foreign countries who were in America looking for positive interdependence,” Clinton told the audience. Nevertheless, Clinton —  who was addressing the crowd just two years after 19 foreign terrorists killed thousands of people on U. S. soil —  proceeded to argue that the nation’s open borders ought to be opened even further:  “The opposition to globalization in the world is rooted in the feeling of some people that they are left out, left behind and stepped on by other countries. If you, like me, believe in expanded trade and believe America has greater obligations to open our borders and to invest more in the development of poor countries, we have got to maintain the political support here in America for doing that. ” Clinton suggested that creating a global community built upon shared prosperity is necessary in order for wealthy nations to continue to keep their borders open: “We also have to share the benefits of the interdependent world. Why? For one thing, if you come from a wealthy country with open borders, unless you seriously believe you can kill, imprison or occupy all of your enemies, you have to make a world with more friends and fewer enemies, with more partners and fewer terrorists. ” Clinton was correct in his assessment that the September 11th terror attacks were a result of the nation’s open borders immigration policies. Indeed, all nineteen of the September 11th hijackers were voluntarily imported into the country on visas issued to them by our federal government. Five of the September 11th hijackers had overstayed their visas or violated the terms of their permits. In a blockbuster 2002 report, National Review’s Joel Mowbray acquired the visa applications of 15 of the 19 hijackers and exposed how every single one of their applications should have been flatly rejected. It is interesting that Clinton described the nation’s immigration policy of 2001 as being one of “open borders,” considering that immigration has only continued to increase since then, and Hillary Clinton has repeatedly backed immigration policies that would only further open our nation’s borders to   foreign migrants. Before September 11th, immigration experts observed that the nation was experiencing “unprecedented” number of immigrants by historical standards. As the Center for Immigration Studies’ Steve Camarota reported in January of 2001: “By historical standards, the number of immigrants living in the United States is unprecedented  …     28. 4 million immigrants now live in the United States, the largest number ever recorded in the nation’s history, and a 43 percent increase since 1990. As a percentage of the population, immigrants now account for more than one in 10 residents (10. 4 percent) the highest percentage in 70 years. ” The record level of immigration into the U. S. was the result of a 1965 immigration rewrite championed by Ted Kennedy, which lifted the immigration curbs enacted by President Calvin Coolidge and opened up American visas to the entire world. As Camarota wrote in 2001, “The number of immigrants living in the United States has more than tripled since 1970, from 9. 6 million to 28. 4 million. As a percentage of the U. S. population, immigrants have more than doubled, from 4. 7 percent in 1970 to 10. 4 percent in 2000. ” “More than 1. 2 million legal and illegal immigrants combined now settle in the United States each year,” Camarota added, at the time. While in the early 2000s, Clinton described this immigration policy as “open borders” since then immigration has only increased. As Camarota now tells Breitbart News today, “census data shows that each year the U. S. adds 1. 5 million legal and illegal new arrivals. ” “A new analysis of government data from December 2015 indicates that more than 61 million immigrants and their   children under age 18 now live in the United States roughly   (45. 3 million) are legal immigrants and their children,” Camarota wrote in March. “The numbers represent a complete break with the recent history of the United States. ” Despite Bill Clinton’s prior forthrightness about his support for open borders, many in corporate media today insists that Hillary Clinton does not support open borders. While Republican nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly made the case that his opponent supports open borders, many in the media have denounced Trump’s assertion as false —  without providing any substantive evidence to counter his claim. For instance, Politifact, the Associated Press, CNN, and FactCheck. org have all claimed that it is not true that Clinton supports open borders. They make this case by pushing unrelated arguments about how Clinton supports “border security” —  which has nothing to do with the fact that she endorsed, championed and, is now campaigning, on open borders immigration policies that would allow virtually unlimited amounts of foreign migrants to enter the country on U. S. visas. These   “fact checks” rarely mention how many migrants would be imported into the country under a Hillary Clinton Presidency. While Bill Clinton described the immigration policies of 2001 as “open borders,” his wife has championed policies that would only open our borders even further. For example, the 2013 Gang of Eight bill Clinton supported would have tripled green card issuances —  permanently resettling 33 million foreign nationals on green cards in the span of a single decade —  and would have doubled foreign guest worker visas to compete for American jobs. The 2006 Ted Kennedy immigration plan Clinton supported would have more than doubled legal immigration by increasing the number of   and   visas. Clinton’s refugee program, which she outlined in 2015, calls for a 550 percent increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted. If Clinton were to continue this policy throughout her presidency, the U. S. could potentially permanently resettle nearly one million Muslim migrants during the first term of her presidency alone —  and all of their children born on American soil would be automatically awarded U. S. citizenship. Indeed, Clinton primary rival Bernie Sanders has explained how “open borders” is a radical and fringe position supported by wealthy donors, which hurts working Americans. In a 2015 interview with Vox, Sanders denounced open borders as a “Koch brothers proposal” that would essentially amount to “doing away with the concept of a nation state. ” Sanders said “open borders” is “a Koch brothers proposal  …     which says essentially there is no United States  …     It would make everybody in America poorer —  you’re doing away with the concept of a nation state, and I don’t think there’s any country in the world that believes in that. If you believe in a nation state or in a country called the United States or UK or Denmark or any other country, you have an obligation in my view to do everything we can to help poor people. What   people in this country would love is an   policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don’t believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country. ” Interestingly, the libertarian Koch Brothers are furthering Hillary Clinton’s candidacy by refusing to run negative ads against her. Clinton’s push back against the “open borders” label while clearly championing open border policies is perhaps related to the fact that increasing immigration levels is not a popular policy. According to Pew, an overwhelming 83 percent of the American electorate overall would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced."
2016-09-24,"When Hillary Clinton takes the podium at Monday night’s first   she could be staring down an old romantic rival sitting in the front row. Gennifer Flowers, who carried on a   affair with Bill Clinton when he was attorney general and governor of Arkansas, might attend the debate at Hofstra University as Trump’s guest,   Saturday. “Ms. Flowers has agreed to join Donald at the debate,” her personal assistant, Judy Stell, wrote in an   to BuzzFeed, according to the Web site. The development grew from a Twitter broadside Trump launched earlier that day. “If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!”  . It was a shot at Clinton’s decision to seat Cuban, a frequent Trump critic,   and a signal that the Republican nominee might dredge up past Clinton scandals as ammunition. Trump originally misspelled Flowers’ first name, then sent a corrected tweet minutes later. The Trump campaign and Flowers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The spectacle of the buxom blond lounge singer shooting daggers at Hillary Clinton  —   perhaps just a few seats away from her former lover, Bill Clinton, who is expected to attend  —   would only draw more eyeballs to a debate already  . The   LI  —   the first of three planned presidential debates  —   begins at 9 p. m. Monday, moderated by NBC’s Lester Holt. The   venue will be packed with 300 Hofstra students and about 400 invited guests for each campaign. Coming only six weeks before Election Day, Monday’s contest could be a  defining moment in the presidential race. And it has already  become a    phenomenon. “It’s a   show equivalent of ‘Who Shot JR’ from ‘Dallas,’ ” said political consultant Susan Del Percio. “Everyone wants to see what Donald Trump is going to do and how Hillary Clinton will respond. He is setting the tone of the debate. ” But getting ready for their shining moment is no easy task. “Prepping for a presidential debate from a communications standpoint is one of the hardest things in the world to do,” Democratic consultant Dan Gerstein said. “You have to know your own policies, your opponent’s vulnerabilities, what your message is, and how to play defense. ” Trump’s advisers are worried he’s doing too little to prepare. The mogul has skipped reading policy briefings, eschewed mock debates, and turned away two GOP operatives who offered to help prep him for free, said three sources close to the campaign. But Trump sees the lack of prep as a strength, allowing him to bring spontaneity into the debate and making him more “unpredictable,” a source said. But he has been receiving advice from top advisers, like former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who feeds him potential questions on his campaign plane flights, a source said. Trump “thinks all he has to do is get four good sound bites and two big hits on her and the public doesn’t care about anything else,” a source said. Trump has not employed a Clinton   to practice debating against, a standard practice in   prep. His camp’s biggest worry, sources said, is his being challenged by the former secretary of state on  foreign affairs. “Substantively, he is behind the curve in shocking ways,” the consultant said. “This could be a disaster, but then again, he’s proven people wrong time and again. ” Meanwhile, Clinton has been cramming like a college student hellbent on graduating summa cum laude. The Democratic nominee cleared much of her schedule last week to huddle with top campaign staff, read policy briefings and conduct mock debates with Philippe Reines, her former State Department aide who will portray Trump. But anticipating Trump’s reactions on the debate stage has proven difficult, Clinton allies say. “It’s still hard to portray him in that kind of setting,” one former Clinton aide said. “You don’t know what he’s going to do or say. The unpredictability factor looms large. ” Clinton, who trails Trump in several state and national polls, may have more to lose if her performance is underwhelming. “This is her election to lose, and right now she’s in a danger zone,” said Gerstein. “She needs to avoid getting bogged down in a food fight with Trump. ” If Trump, on the other hand, avoids significant  errors and refrains from personal attacks, he could emerge victorious, said  observers. But the presence of Flowers, and the specter of resurrecting 1980s Bill Clinton scandals, could turn the debate into a nasty slugfest. The revelation of Flowers’ affair with Bill Clinton  —   the first of many “bimbo eruptions,” as his inner circle called them  —   nearly derailed his White House hopes in 1992, one month before the New Hampshire primary. Rumors of infidelity had haunted Clinton from the moment he announced his candidacy, but when Flowers told a supermarket tabloid that she and the governor had carried on a torrid,   relationship, he and wife Hillary sat for an awkward “60 Minutes” interview to save the campaign. Bill Clinton admitted that he had “caused pain” in his marriage, but would not confess to the relationship with Flowers  —   or admit to having obtained a state job for her. Instead, he maintained that his private life had no place in the presidential campaign and refused to say whether he had ever committed adultery. The next day, a furious Flowers called a press conference at New York’s   Hotel to tell 200 reporters that Clinton had been “absolutely lying” by denying their affair. She played 15 minutes of phone conversations between the two in which Clinton instructed her to lie about having been his lover. “If they [reporters] ever hit you with it, just say ‘no’ and go on  —   there’s nothing they can do,” said a voice that she claimed was  Clinton’s. “The man on ‘60 Minutes’ is not the man I fell in love with,” Flowers told the press. “I would have liked to think, after a   relationship, he would have had the guts to say: ‘Yes. I had an affair with this woman. But it’s over. And that’s the truth.’ ” Clinton remained in the race, though his poll numbers took a beating. He was dubbed “The Comeback Kid” when he took second place in New Hampshire and went on to win the Democratic nomination. Six years later, Flowers was vindicated when lawyers for Paula Jones, who had accused Clinton of sexual harassment, forced him to admit under oath that Flowers had been telling the truth."

2016-09-26,"An ABC   Post poll finds Donald Trump crushes Hillary Clinton among white men without college degrees 76 percent to 17 percent —  a   lead. [For comparison, failed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won this voter bloc by 31 points in 2012. Trump shot from 64 percent support to 76 percent in September alone, while Clinton sank from 24 percent to only 17 percent.  Among   white women, Clinton leads Trump 57 percent to 32 percent, an increase from earlier in September, when she led Trump by 10 points at 50 percent. These results are again inverted when comparing “  white men and   white women,” ABC News reports: Trump also leads among   white men and   white women, by 11 and 12 points, respectively. As a result, he leads by 16 points among whites overall, while Clinton leads by 50 points among nonwhites, a bit less than the typical Democratic margin. (One reason is that 6 percent of nonwhites favor Johnson or Jill Stein of the Green Party.) Further, Clinton now leads by 19 points among women, Trump by 19 among men —  a yawning   gender gap, triple the average gender gap in exit polls dating to 1976. Breitbart News earlier dug into a Kaiser Family   poll finding 84 percent of white working class voters say the government doesn’t represent the views of people like them: Nearly half, or 47 percent, of working class whites feel the country’s best days are behind us. Only 18 percent feel satisfied with the country’s economic situation, with 78 percent dissatisfied —  and 53 percent very dissatisfied. Only 24 percent feel satisfied with “the influence people like you have on the political process,” with 45 percent feeling very dissatisfied. Half of working class whites believe that when their children reach their age, their standard of living will be worse than theirs is now.   percent of working class whites believe that over the past few years, it’s gotten harder for people like them to “get ahead financially,” while 67 percent feel it’s gotten harder to find good jobs.   percent of working class whites told pollsters they would consider voting for Donald Trump, while only 28 said they would think about voting for Hillary Clinton  …     Of registered voters, 60 percent of working class whites said they would consider voting for Trump, but only 29 percent said the same for Clinton. Trump’s populist, nationalist platform with “America First” positions, particularly on on immigration, trade, and war, has upended the political establishment and drawn working class voters. The poll surveyed 1, 001 adults (including 651 likely voters)] with a margin of error of plus or minus 3. 5 percent for the full sample, and 4. 5 percent for the likely voters polled from Sept. 19 to Sept 22."
2016-09-27,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, In 2006, two years before the crash that would destroy the livelihoods of millions of Americans, Donald J. Trump said he “sort of hope[d]” for that eventuality. He stood to make money. Confronted by Hillary Clinton with that comment at Monday’s debate, Trump did nothing to disavow it. To the contrary, he defended it: “That’s called business, by the way,” he condescended. Together these remarks showcase a callous indifference to other people’s hardships —  an indifference that, my colleague Conor Friedersdorf writes, “may matter little for a Manhattan mogul, but matters very much for someone asking to be entrusted with representing every American. ” No reasonable person who has followed along over these last few months could view such an attitude as an aberration. Rather, it fits in precisely with Trump’s long and documented history of putting himself first, even when it means demolishing those who are in his way. Here is a person, a person who may very well become the next president of the United States, who is seemingly unable to imagine what it’s like to be someone else. But these comments represent another failure of the imagination as well, and that is a total deference to an idea of “business” to be obeyed as though it were handed down to Moses at Sinai. “Business” is not some eternal, naturally occurring phenomenon. It is socially constructed, guided by the laws and cultures of a given time and place, and the sort of business that Trump reveres is in fact very specific to America over the last four decades or so. During the 20th century up until the 1980s, it was common for business leaders to see the purpose of their endeavors as including contributing to the public good. Corporate mission statements of this era often contained objectives such as providing good jobs for people and a responsibility to “the communities in which we live and . .. the world community as well,” as Johnson  Johnson’s did in 1943. It is only in recent years that corporations have pursued a singular aim above all else: to bring returns to shareholders, even when doing so comes at the expense of jobs or investing in research. Trump is emblematic of the values of this particular variety of capitalism, prizing profits over any social purpose. This has made him incredibly wealthy, he says. Lucky Donald. Now he has ridden that wave to the presidential debate stage, whatever the wreckage of human lives left in his wake. But all is justified under the mantle of “business,” in Trump’s telling greed and cruelty are fine —  in his estimation, often brilliant, I suspect —  in the name of profit. This is a contested view, to say the least. There are, in the pages of history and in the news, countless examples of business and political leaders who have sought to reform markets and the economy in service of some higher purpose. But Trump isn’t interested, and dismissing his erstwhile hope for economic catastrophe with a quick “that’s called business” line is to fail to engage in the question of what business is or what it could be, to assume that no other way is possible."
2016-09-28,"A University of Nebraska regent thinks the three Cornhuskers who knelt for the national anthem on Saturday should do so on their own time and not on the school’s dime. [“It’s a free country,” Hal Daub, a former mayor of Omaha, explained to the Lincoln Journal Star. “They don’t have to play football for the university, either. They know better, and they had better be kicked off the team. ”  Daub subsequently denied calling for their removal from the squad to both the Journal Star and the Associated Press. He affirmed his other criticisms of the players. Linebacker Michael   defensive end DaiShon Neal, and linebacker Mohamed Barry all took a knee during the national anthem at a road game against Northwestern on Saturday. The Cornhuskers prevailed  . “They won’t take the risk to exhibit their free speech in a way that places their circumstance in jeopardy, so let them get out of uniform and do their protesting on somebody else’s nickel,” Daub told the newspaper. “Those publicity seeking athletes ought to rethink the forum in which they chose to issue their personal views at the expense of everyone else. ” The school’s president stood by the players and said the First Amendment protects them from repercussions. Head coach Mike Riley praised his players. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts called the demonstration “disgraceful” and “disrespectful. ” The players see it differently. “As we looked at what’s been going on in this country, the injustices that have been taking place primarily against people of color, we all realized that there is a systemic problem in America that needs to be addressed,”   explained Monday. “We felt it was our duty to step up and join the chorus of athletes in the NFL, WNBA, college and high school using their platforms to highlight these issues. ”"
2016-09-29,"  The deadly crash of a New Jersey Transit train underscores the need for a critical system that’s currently missing on some of America’s busiest railways. Part of the investigation into Thursday’s crash that killed one person and injured more than 110 others will focus on a safety system that prevents trains from colliding, derailing or speeding, according to Bella   vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. ”That is absolutely one area that we always look into for every rail accident,”   said of the technology, which is called positive train control. New Jersey Transit trains don’t have it    they operate on a safety system that has been in place for nearly 40 years.  A missed deadline, Congress originally required the newer technology to be operational by the end of 2015. However, it extended the deadline to the end of 2018 to avoid a possible shutdown of the nation’s railroads.  ”Every   accident, death and injury on tracks and trains affected by the law will be a direct result of the missed 2015 deadline and the delayed implementation of this   technology,” NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said earlier this year. The cause of Thursday’s crash is unclear as of now. However,   said investigators will be looking at a 2011 crash in Hoboken that injured 33 people. That crash was caused by ”the failure of the engineer to control the speed of the train entering the station,” according to the NTSB.   The lack of a positive train control system also contributed. The agency said it ”would have intervened to stop the train and prevent the collision.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it’s too early to know whether PTC could have made a difference in Thursday’s crash. What we do know is that the train was going very fast when it entered the station, where the speed limit is just 10 mph.  Bhagyesh Shah, who was riding in the back of the front car, said the train didn’t appear to slow as it entered the station. ”The next thing I know, I’m on the floor,” he said. ”We are plowing through something . .. and when the train came to a stop. I could see the parts of the roof on the first car and some of the debris next to me.” An event recorder recovered from the locomotive will reveal the train’s speed and other information,   said.  What the NJ Transit trains DO have,   didn’t know whether the train was equipped with an ”alerter” system, which requires engineers to respond to alerts, sound an alarm if they are unresponsive and eventually brake the train in an emergency.   The New Jersey Transit uses a less comprehensive system known as Automatic Train Control (ATC) to slow speeding trains, said Steve Ditmeyer, a former Federal Railroad Administration official and professor at the University of Delaware. ATC has been in place throughout the Northeast corridor    the most heavily traveled rail network in the country    for nearly 40 years. The system notifies an engineer if a train is speeding and applies the brakes automatically if the engineer does not respond. The engineer working that day is critical to this investigation. He was critically injured in the crash.  Newer safety system is costly, Many publicly financed railroads, including the New Jersey Transit, have been slow to switch to the newer technology because of the cost, Ditmeyer said.  ”There (has) just been a continuous series of accidents that could have been prevented with PTC,” he said. ”I’m not sure if this (accident) is going to make (PTC implementation) go any faster, but we again see how important this system is.”  The railroad industry has opposed PTC because of the high cost and technological issues.  Many freight railroads already use it    but it came with a hefty price tag. Freight rail companies spent nearly $6. 5 billion to develop PTC, and they have retained more than 2, 400 signal system personnel to implement it, according to the Association of American Railroads. Some experts have floated other ideas to increase safety.  David Rangel, president of the Modoc Railroad Academy, said putting another person in the engineer’s cab    a practice common in airplane cockpits and many freight lines    could help prevent accidents if the engineer becomes incapacitated. 65 deaths. 1, 100 injuries. Millions in damages. The NTSB has said positive train control could have prevented numerous railroad accidents involving human error.  Since 2004, the agency has investigated at least 25 train accidents that have killed 65 people, injured more than 1, 100 and caused millions in damages    all of which could have been prevented or mitigated by positive train control. The NTSB often cites a handful of deadly crashes to drive home the need for PTC:  December 2013: A   train derailed in the Bronx, killing four and injuring dozens. The engineer fell asleep and didn’t slow the train from more than 82 mph to the maximum authorized speed of 30 mph as it entered a curve. May 2015: An Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia, killing eight and injuring more than 200. The train’s engineer was distracted after his attention was diverted to an emergency involving another train. ”Unless positive train control is implemented soon, I’m very concerned that we’re going to be back in this room again, hearing investigators detail how technology that we have recommended for more than 45 years could have prevented yet another fatal rail accident,” Hart said when findings on the Philadelphia crash were released."
2016-09-30,"The Department of Homeland Security says computer hackers have attempted to break into parts of the computerized voting systems in more than 20 states. [Hackers probed nearly   state voting systems in an act officials are calling a “probing of concern,”an DHS official told Politico.  Officials say computer networks are constantly being probed by hackers, but the recent attacks are of a much more concerted nature. ”It’s reached a threshold of some concern,” the official told the online news outlet. DHS has offered to help the states monitor their systems for hackers and are providing Attorney Generals with digital scans of their voting systems. Some lawmakers are blaming Russia for the hacks, but no solid proof of the allegation has been produced by the federal government. Recently Professor John F. Banzhaf, III, warned that the 2016 election is ripe for being hacked by foreign powers. A “claim that the 2016 presidential election could be rigged is all too true,” Banzhaf wrote at Breitbart last month, “and there’s a growing recognition from many different segments of the political spectrum that the winner could be decided by a small group of hackers, perhaps working for a foreign power. ” “Today what’s even more scary is that a hacker with malware can steal more votes than a corrupt mayor or governor,” Banzhaf added.

2016-10-01,"Washington  Pastors across the country are taking to their pulpits this Sunday to protest an Internal Revenue Service law that they say limits their religious freedom. Pulpit Freedom Sunday is an initiative started in 2008 by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative     focused on defending religious liberty. ”The ultimate goal of Pulpit Freedom Sunday is to restore a pastor’s right to speak freely from the pulpit without fearing government censorship or punishment,” said Erik Stanley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom. ”The IRS currently holds the power to impose legal sanctions on a church for something its pastor preaches from the pulpit.” As a senator, Lyndon B. Johnson backed a change in the US tax code that blocked some   organizations, including churches, from supporting or opposing political candidates. ”Until 1954, America’s pastors had the right to speak freely they exercised that right responsibly,” Stanley said. ”Churches were not turned into political action committees and party bosses did not set up shop in the basement of churches. Instead, pastors spoke out as they believed their faith intersected with something that was happening in an election. Pastors should have the right to decide that issue for themselves.” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pledged to repeal the ”Johnson Amendment” should he win. ”The Johnson Amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits,” he said at the Values Voter Summit last month.  ”If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they’re unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their   status,” he said. ”All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson Amendment if I am elected your president, I promise. So important.” Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the Johnson Amendment. The IRS told CNN that federal privacy laws prohibit the agency from commenting on any individual taxpayer or case. But Jim Garlow, lead pastor of Skyline Church in San Diego, has tried to get the IRS to comment on this issue for years. ”We record our sermons, as have many several thousands of pastors, and then send their sermons to the IRS in the hopes of provoking a lawsuit. But we have not been successful,” he said. Although ADF advocates for more traditional social issues like marriage and abortion, the group is not endorsing a candidate or encouraging pastors to address certain issues. ”ADF remains firmly committed to the goal that Pulpit Freedom Sunday is not about any particular issue or candidate or election, but is about restoring the right of pastors to speak freely from their pulpits and removing the censorship and punishment power from the IRS,” Stanley said.  Trump supporter Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council, said that although pastors don’t need to choose a candidate, they do need the freedom to do so if they want. ”As a pastor, you have a biblical responsibility to speak to your congregation and help them understand the issues and how they line up with Scripture,” he said. ”We’re simply going down the list of biblical issues like life and human sexuality and marriage and speaking to what Scripture has to say and juxtaposing that with the positions of the candidates.” But not all clergy are in favor of religious leaders using the pulpit to make political endorsements. Broderick Greer, curate at  . Luke’s Episcopal Church in Memphis, Tennessee, believes support for Pulpit Freedom Sunday is due to more conservative leaders losing influence in an increasingly diverse climate.  ”I don’t see our relationship with the people we’re serving as one of paternalism,” he said. ”I would never want to tell people who they should vote for.” ”If you want to lose your   status, then feel free to make an endorsement from your pulpit. If you don’t then, you don’t,” he added. ”I think the broader question is should religious organizations have   status at all.”"
2016-10-02,"Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by six points in New Jersey, according to a Stockton poll published Friday. [Ten percent of the likely voters said they would vote for “nobody,”   a candidate, or possibly vote for a   candidate.  The first presidential debate on Monday occurred during the polling period, but according to the results, Clinton led Trump by four points before the debate. Her lead increased to six points after Monday night’s debate. The poll questioned 638 likely voters in New Jersey from Sept. 22 to Sept. 29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3. 9 percent. “New Jersey is a blue state, so it’s not surprising Clinton is ahead,” said Hughes Center Executive Director Sharon Schulman, which conducted the poll. “But there are still 14 percent who are undecided or not choosing either Clinton or Trump at this point. ”"
2016-10-03," Morgan Stanley was charged with ”dishonest and unethical conduct” by Massachusetts’ top securities regulator on Monday for having pushed its brokers to sell loans to their clients. Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin alleges that the bank ran   sales contests in Massachusetts and Rhode Island where brokers could earn thousands of dollars for selling   ”securities based loans.” (SBLs) The contests, designed to boost business, were officially prohibited by Morgan Stanley but turned out to be lucrative for the bank with the pace of loan origination tripling and adding $24 million in new loan balances, Galvin said. The charges against Morgan Stanley come one month after Wells Fargo was fined for fraudulently opening accounts and illustrate how large banks are facing increasing scrutiny over their sales practices. Securities based loans let clients borrow against the value of their investment accounts but involve certain risks including the bank’s ability to sell securities to repay the loan. Morgan Stanley said the complaint has no merit and that the company plans to defend itself vigorously. ”The   loan accounts were opened only after discussing the product with each client and obtaining their affirmative consent,” spokesman James Wiggins said in a statement. But Galvin charges that Morgan Stanley executives were slow in discovering the improper sales contests, failed to shut them down immediately, and downplayed the risk associated with the SBLs.  ”This complaint lays bare the culture at Morgan Stanley that bred the high pressure effort to cross sell banking products to its brokerage customers without regard for the fiduciary duty owed to the investor,” Galvin said in a statement. The practice of    —   or getting customers to buy products and services from a range of business lines  —   is common across the banking industry. But the scandal involving Wells Fargo has raised questions about whether it is appropriate to set aggressive sales targets for employees, and whether customers really need all the products they are being offered. Thirty financial advisers working in five Morgan Stanley offices from Springfield, Massachusetts to Providence, Rhode Island joined in the contest that began in January, 2014, Galvin said. The incentives were: $1, 000 for 10 loans, $3, 000 for 20 loans, and $5, 000 for 30 loans, Galvin said, adding that  performance was closely tracked by supervisors. Four years ago the bank shifted the way its advisers are paid, rewarding them for growing assets and loans.  Morgan Stanley’s internal rules prohibited such contests, Galvin said, adding it took the bank’s compliance and risk office until December 2014 to detect the contest and that it was not stopped until April, 2015, Galvin said. At Wells employees opened as many as 2 million fake accounts in customers’ names without their permission, saying they were under intense pressure to meet internal sales quotas. In the aftermath of the settlement and harsh questions from lawmakers, Wells has since suspended those quotas.  The San   bank is now facing probes from authorities ranging from the Department of Justice to the Department of Labor, as well as lawsuits from customers and former employees.

2016-10-04," This year’s Nobel Prize in physics goes to three men, who, in their work in the 1970s and 1980s, explained the very weird thing that happens to matter when you squish it down to a flat plane, or cool it down to near absolute zero.     Half the prize goes to David Thouless of the University of Washington, and the other half is split between Duncan Haldane of Princeton University and J. Michael Kosterlitz of Brown. All the laureates were born in the UK.  The prize is a reward for their theoretical work, said Thors Hans Hansson, a Nobel committee member, at the Nobel announcement. “It has combined beautiful mathematics and profound physics insights, and achieved unexpected results that has been confirmed by experiments,” Hansson said.     So what, exactly, did Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz prove?     In essence, they showed that the bizarre properties of matter at cold or condensed states  —   for instance, when   materials conduct electricity without resistance  —   could be explained by the mathematics of topology.     Topology is a branch of math that studies what properties are preserved when objects are stretched, twisted, or deformed. Hansson, apparently anticipating our total ignorance of topology, helpfully brought along a cinnamon bun, a bagel, and a pretzel to explain it at the prize announcement. You can describe the number of holes in each shape topologically, he said. A bun has zero holes, a bagel has one, and a pretzel has two. There are no half holes. And the number of holes in these objects stays the same if you stretch or twist them.    Here he is explaining:   Member of the Nobel committee for physics explains topology using a cinnamon bun, a bagel and a pretzel https:  .  —   The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 4, 2016    Using topology, Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz were able to elucidate mysteries like how   films of helium change their phase of matter, and how those phase transitions then change their properties (like how conductive they are to electricity and magnetism). Beyond theory, the research has also led scientists to develop new materials with novel properties, said Nils Mårtensson, acting chair on the Nobel committee on physics. Some of these materials are called “topological insulators,” which conduct electricity solely on their surface.             These topological insulators haven’t made it into any commercial products yet, but the Nobel committee and the scientists are still excited about the possibilities for using them in quantum computing and other    discovered applications. One of these insulators, called stanene  —   basically a   thick layer of tin  —   will conduct electricity at high temperatures with little resistance. One day, scientists hope stanene could perhaps replace copper components in computers.    That this work on topological insulators won the prize is a bit of a surprise. The detection of gravitational waves at LIGO was one of the most stunning physics announcements of the year, confirming a prediction made by Einstein more than 100 years ago. Many predicted the scientists who led that work would win.  Why wasn’t LIGO selected? One answer: The discovery, announced in February, missed Nobel’s deadline for consideration in January. The Nobel Committee also typically awards scientific discoveries many years after they are first shared  —   after they’ve truly changed the field.    Nobel physics Prize apparently didn’t go to   discovery because LIGO announcement missed Nobel’s deadline pic. twitter.  —   Graham Farmelo (@grahamfarmelo) October 4, 2016    And the fact that the winners of this year’s Nobel Prize for physics were again all male did not go unnoticed. Only two women have ever been awarded the honor. "
2016-10-05,"     Marijuana advocates are heading into the final weeks of the 2016 campaign with the wind at their backs as the latest polling shows legalization measures currently favored by voters in all five states where they’re on the ballot. This is something of a reversal from just a month ago, when the most recent polling had shown voters wary of legalization measures in Massachusetts and Arizona. But the margins of support aren’t huge in any state, meaning that the contests could still swing either way. Polling ballot issues is a tricky business, all the more so with   issues, where responses can be heavily influenced by particular question wording. So in the same state, different polls with different question wording can yield radically different results even if fielded at similar times. Those caveats aside, here’s what the latest numbers show. In Arizona, a   Arizona    News poll of 784 registered voters found that 50 percent supported marijuana legalization, 40 percent opposed it, and 10 percent remain undecided. That result is sharply at odds with a July poll of likely voters showing that only 39 percent said they favored the measure. In California, a   SurveyUSA poll of 751 likely voters found that Proposition 64, which would legalize, tax and regulate the sale of recreational marijuana, is supported by 52 percent of the electorate and opposed by 41 percent, with 6 percent undecided. This is a lower margin than some other recent polls there, which have pegged support at 60 percent or more. Across the country in Massachusetts, the marijuana legalization measure there enjoys 53 percent support among likely voters, according to a recent   Amherst poll of 700 likely voters. Forty percent oppose it, while another 7 percent are unsure. That’s also a turnaround from an earlier poll of 900 registered voters, which found only 41 percent supported the measure. Up the coast in Maine, a late September poll of 505 likely voters found 53 percent support for the legalization measure, 38 percent opposed to it and 10 percent undecided. This number has been fairly stable since the spring. A poll fielded last week of 500 likely voters in Nevada found the legalization measure there leading with 57 percent support, compared to 33 percent opposing it. That number is sharply at odds with a   survey of 800 likely voters, fielded at the exact same time, which found the legalization measure leading by just 1 percentage point, well within the margin of error. ”These poll numbers are not surprising,” said Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, in an email. ”Most Americans agree that the responsible adult use of cannabis ought not to be criminalized. The battle now is finding consensus regarding the details of how best to regulate this market.” Marijuana opponents, for their part, are optimistic about their chances. ”If anything, the polls should give the opposition some comfort,” said Kevin Sabet of the   group Smart Approaches to Marijuana. ”If you are not at 60 percent at this stage in the game, it usually spells trouble for ballot initiatives.” Sabet says his group is planning for a busy final month of the campaign season: ”We plan to do much more in the next 30 days.”"
2016-10-06,"’  ’ ’   Sen. John McCain called on Wednesday for increased military   action in Syria to stop authoritarian leader Bashar     whose regime has massacred hundreds of thousands of civilians and   caused a global refugee crisis. ’ ’   In  McCain, who is   chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the case   for US intervention in Syria. ’ ’   The Obama administration has been reluctant to get more involved,   and over the past five years, the conflict has escalated. Russia   is now involved, running airstrikes in support of Assad, and Iran   is also bolstering the regime. ’ ’   ”As bad as this conflict is now, it can get much worse  —   and   likely will,” McCain wrote. ”It will produce millions more   refugees, undermining regional stability and straining the social   fabric of Western nations. It will strengthen an     alliance of Russia and Iran. US credibility with our closest   security partners in the Middle East will further erode. And it   will provide ISIS, or its successor groups, fertile ground to   radicalize Muslims, recruit and inspire them to fight, and   provide them with dangerous battlefield experience.” ’ ’   He continued: ”This is where the conflict in Syria is headed, and   the administration still has no strategy to do anything about it.   Its diplomacy is toothless. And there appears to be .” ’ ’   President Barack Obama has been often criticized for backing down   on his ”red line” in 2013 when he declined to strike Assad regime   facilities after evidence emerged of regime forces using chemical   weapons against civilians. Instead of a military strike, the   Obama administration brokered a deal with the help of Russia that   was supposed to see the removal of Assad’’s chemical weapons. ’ ’   Obama points to this now as a success. ’ ’   ”It continues to puzzle me, the degree to which people seem to   forget that we actually got the chemical weapons out of Syria,”   he told New York Magazine in an interview published this month.   ”The notion seems to be that, ’’Well, you should have blown   something up, even if that didn’’t mean that you got chemical   weapons out. ’’ There continues to be, I think, a lack of   examination of the fact that my decision was not to let Assad do   whatever he wanted.” ’ ’   The president continued: ”My decision was to see if we could   broker a deal without a strike to get those chemical weapons out,   and to go to Congress to ask for authorization, because nowhere   has Congress been more incoherent than when it comes to the   powers I have.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Obama sought approval from Congress for wider military action in   Syria at the time, but support for the plan was low. ’ ”   But McCain wrote that the idea that Congress wouldn’t approve   broader military action now is false. ” ’   ”The administration likes to pretend that Congress is not   prepared to support a more forceful approach because of its lack   of support for military action to enforce President Obama’’s red   line in 2013,” McCain wrote. ”This is a myth. What many in   Congress opposed was granting a reluctant president authority to   conduct what Secretary of State John Kerry promised would be   ’’unbelievably small’’ airstrikes in the absence of a broader   strategy to achieve US national interests in Syria. The US needs   that broader strategy now.” ’ ’   McCain outlined what that ”broader strategy” would look like: ’ ’   The Arizona senator also advocated for providing more   assistance to moderate rebels fighting Assad in Syria, noting   that it’’s the ”only way to isolate and target extremists on the   battlefield.” ’ ’   If left as it is now, the conflict in Syria will ”continue to   threaten the US and destabilize the world,” McCain concluded. ’ ”   The war in Syria has been raging on for more than five years.   Rebels who oppose Assad’s oppressive rule have been trying to   force him from power, and extremist groups have sprung up to take   advantage of the chaos. ” ’   Experts and  have argued that backing down on the   red line hurt US credibility in Syria, making it more difficult   to help solve the conflict now. ’"
2016-10-07,"BAROLO, Italy  —   Few places in Italy, and perhaps the world, have been so gifted with exquisite natural abundance as Barolo and its surrounding region. Not only does this land produce some of Italy’s best, and most expensive, wines. It is also home to the famed Italian white truffle, which can run 200 to 500 euros (about $225 to $560) for a   knob that will sit in the palm of your hand. But what happens when those resources compete? Vines require clear hillsides, and truffles need thick and damp yet clean woods. Today, hillside after hillside of Barolo is planted in neat rows of   vines more valuable than anything else that could be put on them. The forests, on the other hand, have been shrinking. Enter “Save the Truffle,” the brainchild of Carlo Marenda, 34, daytime project manager and passionate truffle hunter, and his associate, Edmondo Bonelli, 35, an environmental consultant. A year ago, the two men met in a chance encounter in a hilltop wood near Alba, the main town of this region in Piedmont, where Barolo is situated. They knew almost immediately that they shared a common goal and complementary skill sets. While Mr. Marenda had inherited two dogs and much knowledge from an older truffle hunter, Mr. Bonelli had the scientific skill to save the tasty tuber for future generations. “We both knew the time was ready to promote a new culture,” Mr. Bonelli said. Soon the two men started meeting with hundreds of truffle hunters and wine producers, and created a website under the “Save the Truffle” name, where they laid out their mission to restore the region’s woods. As they explain it, their mission is not about preserving merely a luxury product, but also the balance of the environment. “We don’t do it for the truffles. You might have only two trees in a hectare where they grow,” Mr. Marenda said. “If these abandoned trees get sick, it’s easy for the parasite to travel to the nearby organic wine production. The whole area is in danger. ” They started working with some wine producers who said they understood the importance of protecting the uncultivated forests around their vineyards and tending to them. Last month, “Save the Truffle” inspired a wider crowdfunding campaign, “Breathe the Truffle,” started by the Alba Truffle Show, an    truffle fair in the autumn that allows hunters to sell their mushrooms directly. It hopes to fund the cleanup of four once   woods in southern Piedmont, and is the first tangible sign of the community’s rising awareness of the need for greater harmony in the environment. “Truffle hunters were complaining more and more,” Mr. Bonelli explained. “Vineyards and wine sales were doing well, and they had time to focus on something that has a   large fallout: environmental preservation. ” Especially in the past decade, the woods in and around Barolo have increasingly been neglected. As wine production has become more profitable, an estimated 30 percent more land has been converted to vineyards in the past 10 years, at the expense of surrounding areas. And the problem is not just that woods are under pressure. Farmers have also stopped collecting forest wood for heating, reducing their incentive to clear the forest floor. On a recent day, Mr. Marenda gave a brief tour of the mounting challenges for truffle hunters, pointing out one of the many slopes of Barolo’s mountains, often angled like the facets of a gem. On one side were rows of nebbiolo grapes, which make Barolo’s wine. On the other was an abandoned, untended wood of oak and poplar trees. The forest floor was so thick with weeds and underbrush there was no way for truffle hunters to enter. “Seven or eight years ago, we could walk into that wood,” Mr. Marenda said. “Now it’s hard even for dogs to explore it. ” Truffles, already tricky to find and certainly no cafeteria food, have become even scarcer. Still, they are big business here. In Italy, the largest zone in Europe for white truffle production, the overall truffle business, which includes the still delicious but less prestigious black truffle, can generate €400 million a year (nearly $449 million). Yet truffle hunting is an ancient activity whose success largely depends on increasingly fickle elements, like the weather and pollution. Climate change, while providing this region’s winemakers with some warm, dry years that have yielded excellent vintages, has not necessarily favored the truffle. Over the long term, if the trends continue, truffle production in certain areas may be reduced or even eliminated, hunters lamented. “White truffles need fresh soil also in the summer, and rain,” said Francesco Tagliaferro, an agronomist at Piedmont’s Institute for Plants and the Environment. “If it’s too hot, truffles do not grow much, or are not very tasty. ” But Mr. Tagliaferro explained that they can only estimate a production loss because official data is scarce. “There is the widespread vow to secrecy about the zones where hunters pick the truffles,” he explained. “And much of the production is sold by private individuals to their own private clients. ” Truffles are a mysterious universe. Italians use dogs to sniff out white truffles underground, and can only guess whether they will still grow in the same area the following year. Many call truffle hunting more of a craze or passion than a job. It is a secretive culture rooted in experience that in Alba has been passed from generation to generation for centuries. Mr. Marenda inherited some knowledge and his two hunting dogs from Giuseppe Giamesio, a   truffle hunter in Alba, who believed that depleting the woods and polluting the environment did not damage just the truffle picking, but also the area’s beautiful hills and the planet. Mr. Giamesio used to travel to truffle fairs showing a handmade sign reminding hunters to be proud of and loyal to their territory. “The project is on the internet now,” Mr. Marenda said. “And so is his legacy. ” It is already reaching a wider audience. Their crowdfunding effort offers   rewards for benefactors, and they hope to raise €50, 000 by the end of the year to help restore the local ecosystem. Through the Alba Truffle Show website, donors contributed €10, 260 in the first two weeks. “It’s a change in mentality that we also want to promote, and so we set the good example,” said Liliana Allena, the president of the Alba Truffle Show. “You may think we are raising money for a luxury product like truffle,” she said, “but we are actually raising environmental awareness for the entire territory. ”"
2016-10-08,"If there’s one thing Rick Astley hasn’t given up, it’s music. The British singer, who is perhaps best known for his 1987 single, ”Never Gonna Give You Up”  —   and the common Internet gag, ”rickrolling,” inspired by it  —   is back with a new album. 50 is already topping the charts in the United Kingdom, and it just went on sale in North America this week. ”It’s been a crazy few months, to be honest,” Astley says. ”I don’t think anybody around me or anybody who knows me was expecting that, to have a No. 1 album in the U. K. again. That was pretty freaky.” Astley joined NPR’s Michel Martin to talk about surprise success, what he really thinks about his ’80s stardom, and why he retired from music in 1993, only to return years later. Hear their conversation at the audio link, and read an edited version below. Michel Martin: Were you nervous coming back after having been out of the spotlight for a bit? Rick Astley: In a lot of ways, no, really. I didn’t have anything to be nervous about  —   because, like I said, we didn’t really have any expectations. I made this record myself in my own studio at home. I wrote it all, produced it, played all the instruments. It’s been a labor of love. It’s been something I kind of wanted to do to mark my 50th birthday, which was this year, but obviously I was making the record last year. I didn’t anticipate anything fantastic happening. I just kind of thought, ”Well, we’ll see how we can put the record out and we’ll see how it goes.” The album is very rich. I think that the word ”spiritual” has been applied. It is not uncommon for people to   themselves with a spiritual side, especially after events that cause people to think differently about their lives. Can you identify something that kind of inspired  —   in every sense of the word  —   this particular sound? I think, for me, even as a small kid, I sang in choirs  —   at the church choir, school choir. They weren’t gospel choirs, that’s for sure, but the idea of singing with other people. When I was having ”Never Gonna Give You Up” and a couple of the other hits, I wouldn’t have thought that deeply about certain lyrics, I don’t think, because they were pop songs  —   It was like, ”girl meets boy, boom,” you know. Having lived a bit longer now, I think certain things that have happened in my life have definitely changed the way I feel about things. The song ”Angels On My Side” is about the fact that I have two elder brothers and an older sister and they looked out for me a lot. My mom and dad got divorced  —   and obviously, my mom and dad looked after me  —   but I’m saying having older brothers and an older sister, that could have gone one of two ways. They could have neglected the youngest kid, and I don’t think they did. I think they looked after me. That’s happened right through my career, as well: I’ve had good people around me. I’ve still got most of my sanity. And I’ve still got some money, which is a freaky thing in this industry sometimes. When people have a pop career, they kind of get churned up and thrown out the other end, and they have a disastrous life sometimes after it. And I’ve had a charmed, amazing life. A lot of these lyrics, as you said, go a little deeper than the pop song often does. And you have been as open as people in your position can really be about the fact that when you were growing up, there were a lot of things going on with your family. All families go through stuff. My mom and dad had a son who died before I was even born, and I think that affects a family in ways you can’t even describe, come to terms with, anything. I think that’s one of the most tragic things possibly to happen to two people. And I was the youngest  —   I was four or five when they got divorced, so I didn’t really know that story. That wasn’t part of my world, really. When you’re around two people who are very, very, very unhappy, i. e. your parents, it’s really tough  —   and that’s why I got into music, I think. I wanted to be at the school choir. I wanted to be at church, even though I wasn’t necessarily very religious. I just wanted to be somewhere else with people my own agem and singing really helped me. One of the songs on the album is called ”Keep Singing,” and that’s kind of, again, what that is about  —   that singing’s been good for me. Your story is so remarkable because, as you mentioned earlier, so often we hear about people like you who had these incredible successes, particularly early in life, and then become a disaster. But you didn’t  —   I mean, you had these huge hits. When you were in it at the time, did you realize how big you were?  Uh, well that sounds a bit heavy. Not heavy  —   it sounds pompous, I think, a little bit. Kind of like ”Do you know how big you were?” I said it, you didn’t! To be honest, having success in America, a couple No. 1s and a few Top 10s, you kind of think, ”It doesn’t get any bigger than that.” But then again, I would look at other artists around my time  —   if you look at George Michael’s career through the ’80s and into the ’90s and stuff, I mean, it’s on a different league, a different level. Another British guy, obviously. So I think, to be fair, it was four or five years of being really famous. And I wouldn’t swap it for anything: It was an amazing experience, you know, because I made quite a lot of money. And I’m one of those people who actually wants to say that, because the way I look at the money side of it is that it bought me freedom. I’ve been free to do a lot of other things that I wanted to do. Nothing maybe too extravagant, but just freedom. When you left the music industry in the early ’90s, what was it that made you decide to go? How is it that you were able to go calmly when so many of your peers just seemed to go off the tracks?  I think it’s a number of things. The manager who looked after me,   and being there and all the rest of it through all my famous time, has never had a drink in his life. And when I said, ”Come on, let’s go and have a few drinks,” he’d say, ”Great, I’ll come with you.” And he’d have a Coke and I’d have a couple of drinks, and at that point, you go, ”Well, I don’t really want a couple more, you’re just drinking Coke.” But I also think having a few drinks in the bar, meeting up with a few people and having a few more, that’s the slippery slope, isn’t it? That’s the point where you do that every night, and then you have to get hammered every night, and then obviously there’s drugs, there’s everything else. And I never really got into that. And I think sometimes the intensity of being famous in the way that I was can drive people to pretty crazy things. And of course you weren’t really gone all this time. Where do you come out on ”rickrolling,” this phenomenon where someone provides a fake hyperlink that leads to a video of you in the famous trench coat, singing ”Never Gonna Give You Up”? I could see where it could be either a huge compliment or it could be kind of annoying. I think it’s been funny, to be honest. For the most part, most of the things have been pretty clever. There’s your basic rickrollers, but there’s been so many things that people have used that song and that video for. They’ve even cut up old President Obama speeches and got him to kind of speak ”Never Gonna Give You Up,” which I thought was pretty amazing. Our daughter was about 15 when that first started, quite a few years ago now. We had a   and she chatted to me about it, and she just said her view on it was that it was nothing to do with me: It could have been any cheesy video from the ’80s that somebody picked, and I should just let it go. And that’s what I’ve done. Why do you say it was cheesy? I kind of liked the video! Well, it’s different. If you look back at photographs of yourself from many years back, you probably look at them and cringe a little bit. And I’m in that same boat  —   I’m just doing it with videos that most of the world has seen. I think most videos from the ’80s are pretty cheesy, to be honest. Is it true you named the album 50 as a little bit of an homage to Adele and her naming albums after her age? Homage is definitely a nicer way of putting it. I didn’t think I’d see my name anywhere on the same page as Adele in the chart in the UK, and boom, there it was. I don’t think she’s worried about what I’m doing  —   I don’t think she’s probably even aware of it  —   but I thought it was just kind of funny. I really like the fact that she called her albums the ages that she was. I mean, that’s what she was doing when she was that age. That’s what she had to give at that age. And for me, this is where I am at 50. This is what I can give and this is what I’ve given, so there it is."

2016-10-10,"While there is no certainty that CBS and Viacom will agree to a merger, Moonves is seeking to capitalize on his   track record at the helm of CBS to gain as much influence as possible over the combined company, the people said on Monday. The    media executive is deliberating his options with advice from famed Wall Street lawyer Martin Lipton, the people said. Lipton’s law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, has been a   advisor of CBS.  Negotiations between Moonves and National Amusements Inc (NAI) through which the Redstones own an 80 percent stake of CBS and Viacom, have not started in earnest, and the exact terms that he will be asking for are not clear, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. A CBS spokesman declined to comment. National Amusements and Lipton did not return calls for comment.  Moonves would not be the first CEO of a media company controlled by the Redstones to seek such assurances for autonomy. Viacom’s former CEO Philippe Dauman was on the board of National Amusements as well as a member of the   trust that takes over Sumner Redstone’s stake in National Amusements after he dies or is declared incapacitated.  But after Redstone removed Dauman from NAI’s board and the trust in May, the executive stepped down in August following a legal battle. He received over $70 million under the agreement. Similarly, when CBS merged with Viacom in 2000, the company’s bylaws gave Mel Karmazin, who was president and chief operating officer of the combined company reporting to Redstone, full operating control.  Also, Karmazin had a stipulation in his contract that Redstone needed   of the board’s approval to fire him. Karmazin resigned in 2004 over differences with Redstone. POSSIBLE MERGER  Sumner Redstone’s daughter, Shari Redstone, has been in favor of recombining the two companies for some time under the leadership of Moonves, sources have told Reuters. A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone said she declined to comment. Both CBS and Viacom have formed independent board committees to consider a merger at the behest of NAI, and whether terms of a merger can be agreed is now up to them. NAI has said it will not support any other transaction, nor will it give up its controlling interest.  In public comments, Moonves has been lukewarm to the idea of combining the two back together again. Viacom, which owns Comedy Central, MTV and film studio Paramount, has been struggling to turn around its declining ratings and ad revenue. ”We are never going to do something that is bad for CBS shareholders,” Moonves said at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor conference last month when asked about a potential  . But combining CBS and Viacom could help both companies better compete with a massive increase in online programming that has shaken traditional business models, and to secure improved terms from    pay TV operators that remain the dominant distributors of programming, Wall Street investors and analysts have suggested.

2016-10-11,"One of the nastiest merger quarrels is about to get uglier. Less than six weeks before health insurance giants Cigna and Anthem are supposed to go to court to defend their $54 billion merger, Cigna is claiming its acquirer breached its agreement, The Post has learned. Cigna is irate because it feels Anthem has not properly prepared its case against the Justice Department, sources close to the situation said. The Justice Department in July sued to block the merger on antitrust grounds. The case goes to trial on Nov. 21. Anthem, America’s   insurer, is   to defend the merger because its executive office lacked direction or leadership, sources said. “It is a fair criticism,” a source close to the case said. “When you turn over control of a company to a buyer, you expect them to have a detailed plan to deal with regulatory concerns through remedies, and not to let it spiral out of control,” the source said. Currently, four of Anthem’s top executives  —   including Chief Executive Joseph Swedish  —   do not work   at the company’s Indianapolis headquarters, a source said, pointing to a reason the company is not prepared. Additionally, two of the four executives who do work in the headquarters started in their positions after the parties signed the merger deal on July 24, 2015. Anthem, meanwhile, is also alleging a breach of the deal by Cigna. The insurer has not provided documentation to regulators in a timely manner, sources said. The merger would create America’s largest health insurer, and that has unnerved the Justice Department. Anthem declined comment for this story, and Cigna did not return calls. Last week, the court recommended that parts of 25 documents sent between the companies be released. The Justice Department believes these documents will show that the proposed merger synergies may not be realized because the companies are not in sync. Part of Cigna’s evidence of its merger partner breaching its agreement is that Anthem did not present the Justice Department with suggestions on how to resolve the conflict of being the parent of   plans and owning Cigna. Anthem is the parent of New York City’s largest “Blue” health insurer. Presently, Anthem works with the Blues to win national accounts from competitors  —   including Cigna. Anthem, after the merger, would be competing with and against the Blues for the same accounts, the Justice Department alleged in its suit. “Anthem’s CEO testified that he did not know how the company would resolve this conflict of interest,” the Justice Department alleged."

2016-10-13,"Zeid Ra’ad   a Jordanian prince who is also the head of the UN Human Rights Council, said Wednesday that U. S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would be “dangerous from an international point of view. ”[The UN Human Rights Council is best known for shielding tyrants, dictators and murderous regimes from scrutiny while targeting Israel. Its current members include such noted human rights exemplars as China, Cuba, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.  Since its establishment in 2003, the UN Human Rights Council has taken 80 actions against Israel  —   more than three times as many as it has taken against Syria, a regime that has deliberately murdered hundreds of thousands of civilians and displaced millions more. It has only taken six actions against Iran and one against Cuba. Actions against Israel make up nearly 30% of the UN Human Rights Council’s activity. Zeid’s own country, Jordan, severely restricts basic liberties. According to the most recent State Department report on human rights, Jordan practices “restrictions on the freedom of expression, including detention of journalists, which limited the ability of citizens and media to criticize government policies and officials citizens’ inability to change their government peacefully and mistreatment and allegations of torture by security and government officials. ” Reid’s remarks have stirred controversy within the UN  —   not because of the substance of his criticism, but because he is perceived to have a habit on commenting on the internal political affairs of other countries. The Associated Press notes: In recent months, Zeid has made speeches that denounced “demagogues” and specifically targeted Trump and several populist leaders in Europe, even likening their tactics to Islamic State propaganda. In Cleveland, Ohio, in April, Zeid alluded to Trump comments at a November rally where he promised to restore waterboarding and introduce even harsher interrogation methods for suspected terrorists. The AP adds: “The comments from Zeid, a Jordanian prince, are likely to fan a debate in U. N. circles about whether he has been overstepping his mandate. ” Joel B.

2016-10-14,"REUTERS  —     politician Geert Wilders can be tried on charges of inciting racial hatred, a court in The Hague ruled on Friday, setting the stage for a politically charged test of freedom of speech laws in the Netherlands. [Judge Hendrik Steenhuis dismissed Wilders’ lawyers arguments that he was being singled out, saying prosecutors have broad leeway in determining when they think someone has crossed the line from offensive speech to discriminatory speech.  Wilders is accused of discrimination and inciting racism for remarks in 2014, televised live, in which he led a roomful of followers in chanting that they wanted “fewer” Moroccans in the Netherlands. Steenhuis set the start date for the   trial on Oct. 31, meaning a verdict would be likely in December  —   well ahead of national elections in March. Wilders’   Freedom Party is    with Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s ruling conservative VVD Party in popularity polls. Wilders response to the ruling was that he was being “prosecuted for what millions (of Dutch people) think. ” Via Twitter he also indicated he thinks the process against him is politically motivated. In 2011, he was acquitted of inciting racial hatred charges for calling for the Koran to be banned and for the deportation of “criminal” Moroccans.

2016-10-15,"US secretary of state John Kerry said on Saturday that Yemen’s Houthi rebels had released two US citizens. The announcement comes days after the US’s first direct involvement in the country’s    civil war. The US has been backing a Saudi   coalition as it assists the Yemeni government’s fight against the   Houthis.  Kerry would not identify the two Americans, who he said were freed on Saturday as part of complicated diplomatic arrangement that included airlifts for Yemenis wounded by an airstrike this past week by the   coalition. Those individuals were taken to Oman for treatment. Speaking to reporters in Switzerland, Kerry said a plane flew the Houthi delegation back to Yemen from the Omani capital, Muscat, and returned with people wounded in the strike, which hit a funeral hall. “This is something we’ve been working on for the last days,” Kerry said. He added that US was “very pleased” with the release and was working to resolve other hostage situations in the region. Peace talks broke down two months ago, at which point Saudi forces, backed by the US, increased airstrikes, but Kerry said he had spoken with Saudi diplomats and the UN envoy to Yemen. He said the diplomats were “continuing to work very hard to get a framework in Yemen that creates a dynamic that allows [negotiators] to get back to the table. “It remains a top priority for us to try to end the violence and get to the table as soon as possible,” he said. “We recognize the‎ humanitarian gesture by the Houthis in releasing these US citizens,” Mark Toner, deputy state department spokesperson, said in a statement. “We call for the immediate and unconditional release of any other US citizens who may still be held. ” Kerry said the US was pushing for a ceasefire in Yemen that would allow the country’s internationally recognized government and the Houthis to return to negotiations. The release came days after the US insisted it did not want direct military involvement in the war. “We don’t seek a wider role in this conflict,” said Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, on Thursday. The White House also said it would review its assistance to the   coalition after the funeral bombing in the   capital of Sana’a left more than 140 people dead and about 600 wounded. More than 100 people who were wounded in the bombing have been allowed medical evacuation to seek treatment outside of Yemen, a Yemeni government official told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The Saudi government, which entered the war shortly after it began, has faced repeated accusations that its campaign has breached international humanitarian law, and last month the Guardian published data indicating that more than a third of the coalition’s airstrikes had hit civilian sites such as school buildings, hospitals, markets, mosques and economic infrastructure. The Houthis have been accused of human rights violations, including the use of landmines, and the United Nations has said more than 10, 000 people have died in the civil war, which began in March 2015.

2016-10-16," A U. S. Navy destroyer was targeted on Saturday in a failed missile attack from territory in Yemen controlled by   Houthi rebels, the third such incident in the past week, U. S. officials said. Multiple    missiles were fired at the USS Mason sailing in international waters in the Red Sea but the warship used   countermeasures to defend itself and was not hit, one defense official said, citing initial information. The latest attack could provoke further retaliation by the U. S. military, which launched cruise missiles on Thursday against three coastal radar sites in   areas in Yemen in response to the two previous failed missile firings against the Mason.  ”The Mason once again appears to have come under attack in the Red Sea, again from coastal defense cruise missiles fired from the coast of Yemen,” Admiral John Richardson, U. S. chief of naval operations, said during a ship christening in Baltimore on Saturday. Another U. S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters: “We are assessing the situation.  All of our ships and crews are safe and unharmed. ” Thursday’s U. S.   authorized by President Barack Obama, marked Washington’s first direct military action against suspected   targets in Yemen’s conflict and raised questions about the potential for further escalation.  The Houthi movement earlier this week denied responsibility for the missile attacks on the Mason and warned that it too would defend itself. The Pentagon on Thursday stressed the limited nature of the strikes, aimed at radar that it suspected enabled the launch of at least three missiles against the Mason on Sunday and Wednesday. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said at the time that the U. S.   were not connected to the broader civil war in Yemen, which has unleashed famine and killed more than 10, 000 people since March 2015 in the Arab world’s poorest country. The United States, a longtime ally of Saudi Arabia, has provided aerial refueling of warplanes from a   coalition striking Yemen and it supplies U. S. weapons to the kingdom. Iran, which supports the Houthi group, said last week it had deployed two warships to the Gulf of Aden, to protect ship lanes from piracy.

2016-10-17,"A judge in Ontario, Canada has denied a request to have the Cleveland Indians barred from using their name and logo in Toronto, in a ruling issued just hours before Cleveland takes on the Toronto Blue Jays in game three of the American League Championship series.  On Monday, the Ontario superior court heard an application arguing the Indians’ name and mascot  —   Chief Wahoo, a cartoon drawing of a man with red skin and a feather tucked in his headband  —   are offensive and discriminatory. The legal challenge was filed by Douglas Cardinal, a prominent architect and indigenous activist based in Ottawa. Cardinal had called for the team to be banned from wearing their regular jerseys and having their logo or team name broadcast in the province. Instead, the team would be referred to simply as the “Cleveland team”. Some three hours before the game was set to begin, Judge Thomas McEwen dismissed his application, ruling that the name and logo of the Cleveland Indians is not discriminatory towards indigenous people under Canadian law. In a statement, Cardinal said he was deeply disappointed. “That this kind of discrimination is not a violation of human rights underscores the challenge Indigenous Persons of North America continue to face,” he said.  “I hope that, one day, the Cleveland team’s ownership will realise that its racist name and logo has got to go  —   entirely. Until then, we will continue to argue our case before the appropriate legal authorities, and call upon everyone who supports our cause for equality to stand with us and express their support for the Indigenous Persons of North America. ” Cardinal, a recipient of the Officer of the Order of Canada, one of Canada’s highest honours, has also lodged complaints over the team’s name and logo with the Ontario human rights tribunal and the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The case is reminiscent of a similar controversy in the US, where campaigners have been pushing Washington’s NFL team to drop their Redskins nickname. On Monday, a spokesperson for Cardinal said the legal challenge was more than just about images and words. “It’s the impact it has on the indigenous peoples. It is this statement that you are separate, that you are something to ridicule, that you’re a source of humour,” said Joe Householder. He added: “Because of the game tonight, because the harm is happening for real, in real time across Ontario, we’re seeking an injunction to stop the use of the logo and the name tonight in the game and in the games going forward. ”  The series between Toronto and Cleveland comes amid Canada’s fledgling efforts to confront its historical mistreatment of the country’s indigenous population. The series has also prompted fresh scrutiny on Cleveland, which for decades has faced homegrown protests to its team name and logo. Renu Mandhane, an Ontario human rights commissioner, last week challenged Canadian journalists to join her in refusing to utter the team’s name. “Will broadcasters  MLB stand up for Indigenous reconciliation and refuse to say the Cleveland name?” Mandhane wrote on Twitter.  The sentiment was echoed by the United Church of Canada and the United Church of Christ, headquartered in Toronto and Cleveland, who came together last week to push the team to ditch its outdated name and logo. “We join together to urge Cleveland’s baseball team to find a new name and a new mascot  —   ones that do not disrespect the wide and varied histories and cultures of Indigenous peoples,” the organisations said in a statement. The Cleveland Indians said the team is “cognizant and sensitive to both sides of the conversation” noting the longstanding and deep attachment many fans have to the logo. “We continue to research our fan base to better understand their perception and stance on the logo, but at present time have no plans of making a change,” the team said in a statement to the Canadian Press. “We continue to have the Wahoo logo represented on our uniforms and home cap during the 2016 season. ”"
2016-10-18,"The Trump campaign released a   TV ad simply titled “Deals” on Tuesday, one day before the final presidential debate. [“Our economy once dominated the world. And our middle class thrived. Today, jobs are gone. Factories closed,” the ad says, blaming bad trade deals on the Clintons.  Trump will renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and cut taxes to make it easier to   manufacturing centers on U. S. soil, the ad says. Senior Policy Advisor Peter Navarro in a statement: The Clintons have influenced every bad trade deal over the past 20+ years. From NAFTA to TPP to shipping our jobs offshore to China, this is the economic disaster of our time. It’s a   disaster with the names of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all over it. We can’t afford any more of Hillary Clinton’s ‘leadership’ on this issue. Donald Trump on the other hand has a plan to cut taxes, reduce regulations, crack down on the trade cheaters, and renegotiate every bad Clinton trade deal in order to put American workers first. Republican president George H. W Bush first negotiated NAFTA and Democratic President Bill Clinton pushed for the passage of NATFA in 1993 with a   Congress, signing it into law in December 1993. “NAFTA is still controversial but people will thank me for it in 20 years,” Bill Clinton said last November. Critics have pointed out NAFTA stripped manufacturing out of the U. S. interior and encourages illegal immigration, particularly from Mexico. Both ruling class families are, of course, vehemently  . Economic Policy Institute researcher Robert E. Scott wrote: Between 1993 (before NAFTA took effect) and 2013, the U. S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17. 0 billion to $177. 2 billion, displacing more than 850, 000 U. S. jobs. Growing trade deficits and job displacement, especially between the United States and Mexico, were the result of a surge in outsourcing of production by U. S. and other foreign investors. The rise in outsourcing was fueled, in turn, by a surge in foreign direct investment (FDI) into Mexico, which increased by more than 150 percent in the   period. Clinton will talk in glowing terms about NAFTA when writing memoirs but criticize it when she runs for office in order to placate progressive labor allies. NPR put together a timeline of Clinton’s   political position on NAFTA and trade, writing at the time the former first lady has “difficulty maintaining a consistent position on international trade. ”"
2016-10-19,"This is the final story in a   series about the relationship between education and mental health. You can read the first piece about mental health in early education here and the second on the lack of teacher training to address   issues here. Today’s college students seek campus counseling services more often than any other generation in the modern history of the United States. Most of those who report   challenges cite anxiety and depression as their top concerns. In last year’s   summary report, the Center for Collegiate Mental Health set out to determine whether the overall growth in enrollment at universities was responsible for the increased usage of these services by retrospectively comparing the growth rates of each. What they found was a dismaying gap: Not only did the rise in demand for counseling services outpace that of enrollment growth, it also outpaced it by five times as much. The increase in demand has sparked a fear, especially among college administrators, that young students across the country are becoming more sensitive and less resilient, which has fed a vigorous national debate between students, faculty, and universities about the treatment of mental health in classrooms. Inevitably, the language of mental health has trickled into higher education. Some universities, like Oberlin, proposed the adoption of trigger warnings, disclaimers intended to protect those with past traumatic experiences such as sexual assault and violence, by forewarning the appearance of disturbing material in text. The pushback against Oberlin’s proposal was swift and vehement. Faculty questioned the loss of academic freedom, the Los Angeles Times called it “the glorification of victimhood,” and Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt, in a widely dissected piece for The Atlantic, argued that such policies were enabling students to develop “  skins” by preventing them from feeling uncomfortable, objectively analyzing their emotional states, and overcoming their setbacks. The emerging picture of the hypersensitive, fragile college student is predicated, in part, on this statistical increase in demand for counseling services. Is there something insidious exposing college students to higher rates of anxiety and depression? Not quite, say leading   experts, who point to answers in a nuanced web of cultural, social, and political changes. Ben Locke, the executive director of the Center for Collegiate Mental Health, believes fears that students have suddenly lost coping skills are unfounded. “You don’t lose resilience as a country, as a population, in five years,” he said. Despite initially discovering that demand for counseling services has increased rapidly in recent years, in further analysis of individual trends, such as rates of attempted suicide, the center found  relatively stable growth rates over the last decade. Only one trend, however, saw a significant jump: the proportion of students seeking counseling services under a category named “threat to self,” which involves thoughts of suicide or  . This specificity, Locke said, suggests a surprising conclusion: that   changes in national policy and culture over the last decade have, in fact, worked. In 2004, Congress signed into law the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, which began funneling millions of dollars toward   research, including early interventions and referral programs. High schools and colleges around the United States started to become more aware of the   issues their students were facing. “When students are in treatment, they are far less likely to be at risk. ” Locke said. “In the last decade, we have been telling students, parents, roommates, friends, if you see somebody who is struggling, refer them to service. ” Beneath the statistics, the rise in demand for   services suggests a heartening prospect: that concerned parents and students did as they were told —  helping make visible people who might have otherwise suffered in silence. Certainly, coming of age in a smartphone culture means that millennials face specific challenges in preserving their mental health, speculated Micky Sharma, the president of the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors (AUCCCD). “We have a group of students who have led busy, hectic lives since they were   all the way to college,” he said. This state of   busyness has likely contributed to the manifestation of anxiety and depression in young students. However, it’s in college that many students, provided with the option of cheap and accessible   services, seek counseling for the first time. John Park, a recent graduate from Duke University, where I also attended as an undergraduate, first visited the counseling center at Duke during his senior year after his anxiety and depression, which had always been in the background, began to inhibit his daily life. Worried about his grades and whether his choices of major and college had been right for him, his schoolwork suffered. On his worst days, Park said, the anxiety would overwhelm him so much that he would stay in bed, waiting for his brain to shut off. He turned in assignments late and missed meetings and lunches with friends. “I hated going through the spiralling, the anxiety attacks. It wasn’t just that half day, it was the next three days because I was behind on schoolwork. ” He called the center, and two weeks later found himself talking to a counselor who encouraged him to verbalize his feelings. “It was good to hear [my counselor] talk about mental health —  like when you go to a physical and the doctor takes your height, weight, and blood pressure. It felt the same way,” he said. Indeed, advocates and counseling directors have long pushed to destigmatize conversations about mental health by placing them on the same, more visible podium that physical problems occupy. With the start of the school year, the National Alliance for Mental Health released a   guide for students and parents, and public figures like Lena Dunham have openly shared their   experiences. Most experts and students I spoke with agreed that the general stigma of seeking counseling services has dropped noticeably in the last few years. Hannah Nguyen, a student at the University of Southern California who has organized Mental Health Awareness Weeks at the university, said that    initiatives, along with media coverage, have improved the situation. “I think students are realizing it’s okay to talk about mental health . .. it doesn’t make you any different or less or weaker in any way. ” Kelly Thorne, a director of outreach services at the University of Vermont, said that universities are doing a good job of decreasing the stigma of   behaviors, but that negative stigma still remains. “We know there’s plenty of students out there who are not seeking support or help because of the stigma. ” This was supported by my own experience writing this article: Despite being eager to talk about visiting their campus counseling centers, some students I spoke to were worried about being included in the story or named, citing concerns that it would affect future social and job prospects. While about half of students who are treated by centers are newcomers to counseling, for the other half, the complexities surrounding the stigma and management of mental health is nothing new. The presence of these students, who first access   services before college, suggest that counseling centers also act as a support system for people with existing   histories: a promising possibility for the increased demand. In the past, potential students with conditions like depression, ADHD, and Asperger’s syndrome were likely discouraged from attending college because they were never treated for their challenges or learning differences. “We didn’t talk about [these conditions] as much in the 1980s, but that doesn’t mean the diagnosis didn’t exist back then,” Sharma said. Now, most   colleges and   colleges offer   services and personal counseling on campus, and 58 percent of   colleges also offer psychiatric services (though only 8 percent of   colleges do). The mainstream existence of   counseling centers on campus provides a     system for   service users who have not found treatment programs easily in the vicinity of their schools. Pooja Mehta, a current student at Duke University, arrived on campus having previously sought therapy for anxiety and depression. When a panic attack suddenly came on in the middle of exam season, a friend brought her to the center, where a counselor sat with her until she calmed down. “They were good to make sure I was being cared for before stepping away,” she remembers. “They didn’t leave me in this  ’s land. ” Mehta’s counselor helped her come up with a care plan that suited her needs, connected her with a   therapist, and contacted her professors to ensure that they made provisions for any missed class work. The close intertwining of campus counseling centers with  faculty often helps both professors and students facilitate a better classroom dynamic and translates to academic success. In last year’s AUCCCD annual report, which surveyed 518 counseling centers serving over 600, 000 students across the country, 71 percent of students surveyed responded positively when asked if counseling services had helped with their academic performance. While once professors might have dismissed poor performance in the classroom as an extension of an uncaring student, now they’re often more attentive to potential   conditions that might express themselves in a student’s academics. Again, this points to overarching shifts in the culture around seeking help. “We have changed the threshold at which people say, ‘Hey, you should get some help,’” Locke said, “so that more students and community members are willing to make that [referral] sooner. ” And the open willingness of university staff and professors in having such conversations can especially help students suffer from chronic mood disorders. Juliette Gobin, a recent graduate of Middlebury College who was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in her sophomore year, credits her dean with helping her balance her illness and her student life. At one particularly difficult time, Gobin’s grandmother passed away. While grieving, Gobin said, “the last thing you want to do is have to apologize to people for someone in your family dying. ” Instead, her dean was able to warn her professors and give her time to recover. “Just the novelty of being able to tell [professors] about this stuff was really important for me. ” Not all professors were understanding of her chronic anxiety disorder, but those that were motivated her to try harder to not let it impede her work. “When we make higher education more accessible for more people in the country, that’s a good thing,” said Sharma, the AUCCCD president. According to the group’s report, over half of counseling centers increased their budgets in the last year. At the Ohio State University center, where Sharma is the director, the university has hired 12 new staff members, an unprecedented number.   new clinical staff were hired across the 10 University of California campuses. Meanwhile, in order to keep up, Sharma said, counseling centers have shifted toward having a “menu of options for students. ” At Ohio State University, one of the largest universities in the country with more than 60, 000 graduate and undergraduate students, the center offers daily   workshops, free yoga classes, and files on   management that can be easily picked up by students on their way to class. This allows center staff to attempt balance the staff to student ratio, while serving the large student body as comprehensively as possible. Unfortunately, that growth has not extended to all areas of the country. Approximately half of counseling centers did not hire new staff, and budgets in a sizable number of centers have not changed to match the increases in enrollment numbers, let alone the increases in demand. And when demand exceeds supply, naturally, waitlists form. At USC, Nguyen said, the waiting period is usually six to eight weeks. “It’s awful. It’s tough because at USC they’re really understaffed and ” she said, calling on the school’s administration to expand services. (Nguyen was able to bypass the waitlist when she was in crisis —  having suicidal thoughts and intense   stress disorder attacks —  after being sexually assaulted by another student earlier in the semester.) Ultimately, increased accessibility, of course, comes with a cost. While centers have prioritized   services so that students who are new or in immediate distress are quickly assessed, the problem of sustaining care remains. The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act allocates grants for suicide prevention and early intervention but not toward clinical services such as psychiatric counseling. A new bill, the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act, which was introduced in Congress this year, would allocate more funding for   services on campuses. If it passes, the bill may remedy that provision and allow more flexible funding for both clinical treatment and prevention. As more students, new and old, continue finding their way to their campus counseling centers, Locke believes the next hurdle is to expand   treatment programs, such as regular therapy sessions, that can be crucial to ensuring students fully recover or manage their conditions.   counseling, said Ali Preston, a law student at Stetson University, allowed her to devote more energy to the activities she wanted to be doing. “The experience was ” she said. Still, not all students had glowing recommendations of their counseling experiences. In defining successful treatment, there is emerging recognition of the importance of having diverse counselors on staff who are   on racial and cultural identities. Park, who is Korean American, said he eventually stopped going to an   counselor because it was too exhausting to explain the intricacies of his cultural background to his white counselor. “Ultimately it ended up feeling like I was trying to educate her on what being a Korean American was, more so than her helping me. ” Close to   of counseling center staff surveyed in the 2015 AUCCCD report identified as white, while just 10 percent are black, 7. 4 percent are Asian, and 6. 7 percent are Latino. A counselor’s cultural competency can ease the burden on students of color to explain their identities on top their   mental conditions. As student enrollment increases and stigma subsides, the demand for counseling will presumably continue to rise. Blaming this crop of students for being less resilient will be a popular diatribe, but it shouldn’t be, Locke emphasized. In fact, it undermines a decade’s worth of work by counselors, psychologists, and student advocates who have strived to not only bring mental health to the forefront of public debate, but to reassure students that there is no shame in struggling —  that experiencing mental distress is not a sign of weakness. “If anything,” Nguyen said, “this is what makes us stronger and makes us more resilient: the fact that I’m fighting for these resources. ” The result of validating mental health in the culture of schools is that faculty, bystanders, and friends have intentionally led sufferers to the centers that promise to help them. “We need,” Locke said, “to follow through on that promise. ”"
2016-10-20,"         Astronomers can’t see “Planet Nine. ” But it makes its presence known. The massive hypothetical object, which supposedly looms at the edge of our solar system, has been invoked to explain the strange clustering of objects in the Kuiper belt and the unusual way they orbit the Sun. Now Planet Nine predictors Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown of Caltech, along with graduate student Elizabeth Bailey, offer another piece of evidence for the elusive sphere’s existence: It adds “wobble” to the solar system, they say, tilting it in relation to the sun. “Because Planet Nine is so massive and has an orbit tilted compared to the other planets, the solar system has no choice but to slowly twist out of alignment,” lead author Bailey said in a statement.  Before we go any further, a caveat about Planet Nine: It’s purely theoretical at this point. Batygin and Brown predict its existence based on unusual perturbations of the solar system that aren’t otherwise easily explained. (This is the same technique scientists used to find Neptune.) But the history of astronomy is rife with speculation that is never borne out: The same guy who correctly predicted the existence of Neptune also believed that a planet he called Vulcan was responsible for the wobble of Mercury. That “discovery” caused the astronomy world to waste years looking for something that wasn’t there. (Mercury’s wobble was eventually explained by the theory of general relativity.) But the evidence offered by Batygin and Brown is compelling. When the pair announced their find in January, planetary scientist Alessandro Morbidelli of the Côte d’Azur Observatory in Nice, France, told The Washington Post: “I don’t see any alternative explanation to that offered by Batygin and Brown. ” “We will find it one day,” he added. “The question is when. ” The new research led by Bailey is based on the observation that the sun rotates on a different axis than the orbits of the planets. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all move around the sun in a flat, shared plane  —   it’s as if the planets were skaters on the same rink. But that plane is tilted at a   angle with respect to the sun (which, from our perspective, makes it look like the sun is tilted).  This tilt doesn’t jibe with how astronomers say the solar system formed: 4. 6 billion years ago, gravity started to pull together a vast, scattered cloud of gas and dust, causing it to spin into a disk. The center of the circle collapsed into a hot, dense ball of gas  —   the sun  —   and the remainder accumulated into planets. Because the sun came from the same disk as everything else, it should be spinning on the same plane. But it’s not. “It’s such a   mystery and so difficult to explain that people just don’t talk about it,” Brown said. Enter Planet Nine. Based on Batygin and Brown’s previous calculations, the hypothesized planet weighs five to 10 times as much as Earth and is, on average, 20 times farther from the sun than Neptune. It takes Planet Nine 10, 000 to 20, 000 years to orbit the sun.    This artistic rendering shows the distant view from Planet Nine back toward the sun. The planet is thought to be gaseous, similar to Uranus and Neptune.( . Hurt, IPAC)  Planet Nine also orbits at an even more dramatic angle than the rest of the planets: about 30 degrees. That fact, combined with its distant location and massive size, could mean that its angular momentum puts the rest of the solar system  . “It’s an argument that is basically like an asymmetrical seesaw or a dolly,” Batygin told Astronomy Magazine. “Planet Nine has a really long orbit, so it can assert quite a bit of torque on the inner planets without having to apply so much force. Planet Nine has as much angular momentum as the entire solar system combined, because its orbit is so big. ” Over the course of several billion years, that could be enough to explain the   tilt we now see.  The study was posted in the online research database ArXiv, and will be published in the Astrophysical Journal this year. The scientists also presented their findings at the American Astronomical Society Division of Planetary Sciences’s annual meeting in Pasadena, Calif. this week. According to Batygin, the research is a “consistency check” for their theories about Planet Nine. It provides another piece of evidence for the planet’s existence, but it doesn’t change our understanding of it or make it any easier to find. He, Bailey and Brown also don’t know why the planet’s orbit would be so   in the first place  —   perhaps it was knocked askew by Jupiter, or was influenced by the gravitational pull of other stars. Most of all, they need to find the darn thing. Scientists have a sense of its orbital path, but that path is thousands of years long. Even with some of the most powerful telescopes scouring the skies, it could be a very long wait.

2016-10-22," The din of bullets, mortars and bombs in the northern Iraqi town of Bartella was replaced momentarily on Friday by a sound not heard there for more than two years: the peal of church bells. A cautious calm returned to this historic Christian area following its recapture from Islamic State a day earlier as Iraqi forces push west towards Mosul, the jihadists’ last major stronghold in the country. Bartella, once home to thousands of Assyrian Christians, emptied in August 2014 when Islamic State seized control as part of a lightning blitz across large swathes of Iraq and neighboring Syria. Nearby Qaraqosh, Iraq’s largest Christian town, remains under the control of militants, according to a commander in the peshmerga, which holds nearby ground. Clouds of smoke were seen billowing from that direction this week, though the source was unclear. Islamic State, which has targeted the adherents and religious sites of minority communities in both countries, issued an ultimatum to Christians: pay a tax, convert to Islam, or die by the sword. Most, including all of Bartella’s residents, fled towards the autonomous Kurdish region. It will be some time before people can return to the town, which witnessed intense fighting on Thursday between Islamic State and troops from the   service (CTS) which are spearheading the Mosul offensive along with Kurdish peshmerga forces and Iraq’s army and national police. The road west into Bartella is littered with the remnants of that battle: bullet casings, deactivated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) shrapnel from car bombs and roadside blasts. The jihadists dispatched more than a dozen   IEDs against government forces in the span of a few hours on Thursday, Iraqi commanders said, but they left many more planted throughout the town’s streets and buildings. CTS spent Friday shuttering tunnels dug by the militants and removing those mines, though some remain in secondary roads and houses. ”Bartella is now safe and secured. It is under our complete control,” said the battle’s commander Major General Maan Saadi, an Iraqi tricolor draped around his shoulders. He told reporters during a brief visit to Saint Matthew’s Syriac Orthodox Church that Islamic State fighters, who pinned down CTS forces earlier in the day with sniper fire, had been completely eliminated. More than 80 jihadists had been killed in the battle, he added, with a few likely fleeing deeper into   territory. Iraqi forces sustained few casualties in the battle, though military officials have refused to provide specific figures. A battalion commander told Reuters two CTS members had been killed.     CHURCH TO TRAINING CAMP Islamic State appears to have removed crosses from atop the steeple and bell tower of Saint Matthew’s church and defaced the statue of a religious figure. The stone sanctuary is in disarray: the floor is covered in filth, wooden pews are toppled and hymnals are strewn about. In an adjoining cemetery, the jihadists had set up a rocket pointing east towards the Iraqi forces previous frontline position. An adjacent administration building was also partially damaged, its windows broken, offices turned upside down and some rooms burned out.

2016-10-23," When Time Warner Inc’s ( ) Jeff Bewkes welcomed AT&T Inc’s ( ) Randall Stephenson for lunch at Time Warner Center in New York in late August, their meeting was supposed to be one of the   the two chief executives have had over the years. And it certainly started that way, with the two men chatting about the direction of the media, broadband and mobile telecommunications industries, according to accounts given by Stephenson and Bewkes as well as people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Stephenson and Bewkes discussed how Time Warner could reach more customers through AT&T’s mobile network, and how that content could reinforce the loyalty of customers. Some of this could be achieved through closer ties and partnerships.  But then Stephenson showed his hand. He proposed an outright merger of the two companies, the biggest shakeup in the U. S. media landscape since U. S. telecommunications giant Comcast Corp’s ( ) takeover of media conglomerate NBC Universal in 2011. ”The more we talked about it, the more it fell into place, that there would be benefits that might be significant and might allow us to evolve the ecosystem faster,” Bewkes told reporters on a conference call on Saturday.  Comcast’s deal had greatly influenced Stephenson’s thinking, spurring him to look for media and video acquisitions now that AT&T had the most video subscribers in the U. S. with 25 million. The media companies he first looked at buying, such as Starz STRZA. O, which later merged with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGF. N, and Scripps Network Interactive Inc ( ) were too small for his liking.  Stephenson’s problem was that the big media companies he deemed attractive were not easy targets. CBS Corp ( ) and Viacom ( ) were family controlled, while Walt Disney Co ( ) with a $150 billion market capitalization, was too big.  When   Century Fox Inc ( ) made a hostile acquisition approach to Time Warner in 2014, AT&T was awaiting regulatory approval on its deal to buy DirecTV, and couldn’t pursue another large deal at the same time. During the year after the DirecTV acquisition closed in July 2015, AT&T had been thinking about going two ways; either a big international acquisition, or a big content deal. Before buying DirecTV, it had looked at combining its business with Vodafone Group Plc ( ) in Europe, according to the sources. But after buying two smaller wireless companies in Mexico, it couldn’t find an international acquisition that suited its appetite.  More than a year after the DirecTV deal closed however, Stephenson felt he had the firepower to pursue Time Warner with an $85. 4 billion    bid, this year’s biggest attempted acquisition globally.  The deal was referred to within AT&T, in order to prevent leaks, as ”Project Bobtail” whose aim was to acquire ”Rabbit” the code name for Time Warner and perhaps a homage to Warner Bros’ Bugs Bunny character. AT&T’s code name was ”Lily” the same as the customer service person who appears in their commercials. ”This thing just had what I would call gravity, and it seemed to move along on its own and we began negotiating out terms very quickly and it was a very natural process,” Stephenson said on the media call. TRUSTED BANKERS     Soon after Stephenson proposed the combination to Bewkes, the companies called in their most trusted investment bank advisers.          AT&T decided to work with Woody Young, who had joined boutique bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP in January. He had worked on deals for AT&T for two decades, and most recently advised AT&T on its DirecTV deal in 2014, when he was at Lazard Ltd ( ).     Time Warner enlisted Allen & Company LLC banker Ketan Mehta, who had been Time Warner’s banker for 12 years and had most recently defended Time Warner from Fox when he was at Citi in 2014. He had also helped defend Time Warner against activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006.     The priority was to keep the deal secret from the media, a challenge given that Time Warner has large fiefdoms in the industry, with HBO in New York, Turner Broadcasting and its news unit CNN in Atlanta and Warner Bros in Los Angeles.  Time Warner never reached out to other potential suitors during its talks with AT&T, according to the sources. Apple Inc ( ) widely speculated as another potential buyer for Time Warner, never showed a strong interest, the sources said, pointing out that after Fox’s bid for Time Warner many other companies considered an acquisition but never made any offers.     Large investment banks were brought on for financing in the week leading up to AT&T’s and Time Warner’s announcement on Saturday. When Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that the two companies had informal conversations about a merger without advisors, Stephenson and Bewkes had already shaken hands on the deal and their boards were close to approving it over the weekend.    To finalize the deal, Time Warner’s board met in the offices of law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP’s offices in New York and AT&T’s board meeting was held at its headquarters in Dallas on Saturday.      The deal was announced Saturday night, which caused Stephenson, an Oklahoma native, to miss a University of Oklahoma college football game. He had to ask a reporter for the score.

2016-10-24,"Kurdish troops backed by foreign special forces including a Turkish contingent advanced on a town near Mosul on Sunday, pushing to within five miles (nine kilometres) of the northern Iraqi city as Islamic State launched another diversionary attack on the western town of Rutba. Sunday’s offensive focused on encircling the strategic town of Bashiqa, known for both its religious diversity and production of the aniseed liquor arak, until Isis took over in August 2014. Its liberation was expected last week when Kurdish peshmerga forces swept into the area, only to be pinned down by a barrage of suicide attacks, buildings filled with homemade bombs, and militants using tunnel networks to reappear in “cleared areas” to launch fresh ambushes. “The suicide car bombs were very strong and we suffered many casualties,” said Jamal Bayaz, a    peshmerga fighting to the east of Bashiqa again, after retreating last week. “We had   ammunition, but the area was hilly and we missed the Isis units. We were lucky at least once, when a suicide bomber attacked but his vehicle broke down before he reached us. ” The Kurdish forces and their allies were taking no chances with the relaunched operation. The might and range of the coalition pushing to oust Isis from their last important stronghold in Iraq was on full display on top of Bashiqa mountain, where much of the operation was coordinated. Two apache attack helicopters hovered over the town, despite a thick pall of smoke from tyres set ablaze by Isis to try to obscure aerial views of the town. At a US special forces base nearby, troops were constructing earth berms for protection, their artillery pointed at Isis positions below. Near the local fighters’ forward outpost two British special forces fighters warned against photographing them as they scanned the valley for enemy fighters, before a hail of mortars flew towards Isis positions. Jets passed overhead and unleashed regular airstrikes on the town, with coalition planes taking out at least three suicide car bombers, according to peshmerga military commanders. Five other car bombs and three suicide attackers on motorcycles were also destroyed. At one point the pace of airstrikes was so fast that Kurdish fighters on one outpost feared their own men had been hit, and British special forces had to reassure them of coordinates. Turkish forces, whose presence has been fiercely criticised by the Iraqi president, Haider   were also watching the town below the   from a base well equipped with radars and armoured vehicles.  There are 500 Turkish troops training both Sunni and Kurdish forces for the offensive at the Bashiqa base, and the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yıldırım, said on Sunday that after requests for support, Turkish tanks and artillery had joined the battle. The government in Baghdad says they had no permission to enter Iraq and has called on them to withdraw, but Turkey has refused, saying it has a role fighting Isis. The US defence secretary, Ash Carter, who arrived in the Kurdistan regional capital, Erbil, on Sunday, has tried to cool tensions. Last week he announced an agreement in principle to give Turkish forces a role in the operation, but since then Abadi has pointedly described the Mosul offensive as an “Iraqi battle”. In reality the campaign, expected to be the biggest in the country since the 2003 US invasion, has drawn together a broad array of national and regional factions, many united only by their desire to push Isis out of Mosul. All agree though that the fighting will last for weeks or even months. The peshmerga said that their operation around Bashiqa had cordoned off eight villages in an area around 38 sq miles (100 sq km) and secured a stretch of highway towards Mosul, hailing it as a “resounding success, achieved ahead of time”. The local Isis commander for Bashiqa, Abu Faruq, was killed with five other local leaders and dozens of fighters, the statement added. But the empty homes and streets still have to be cleared of booby traps. In Bashiqa town, a   Isis unit has dug in, and there are concerns that these fighters could escape to launch another battle or suicide attacks. “We have surrounded the town but there is resistance inside. [Isis] is fighting back with mortars and snipers, as well as heavy machine guns,” said Sabah İbrahim, a soldier with the peshmerga strike force. “We are constructing berms now and a ditch to prevent [Isis] from fleeing, then we will move into the town and the villages around it slowly. ” Isis homemade bombs limited action on a second front to the north, a senior military source said. Kurds were waiting for coalition aircraft to take out Isis fighters in a Christian village near Tel Osqof, he told the Guardian, because braving militants and bombs together risked a devastating casualty rate. Adding to pressure on security forces, the jihadi group has mounted two attacks in cities across Iraq over the last week.  In the western Iraq town of Rutba on Sunday three suicide car bombs launched a coordinated attack, although a spokesman for Iraqi forces said they had detonated before hitting their targets and the situation is “under control” Associated Press reported.  Dozens of security forces and civilians died in an attack by up to 100 Isis fighters in northern Kirkuk city on Friday. The two assaults have served as a show of strength, a propaganda boost for supporters of the group and have drained attention and resources from the Mosul campaign. A team from the UN agency for children, meanwhile, visited an area that had recently been retaken from Isis and found that conditions for children there were “very, very poor” the agency’s Iraq representative, Peter Hawkins, said. The team brought supplies and water expected to last seven days to residents in the area, called   he said. They also provided immunisations against polio and measles, which he said had not been available during the more than two years of Isis rule."
2016-10-25,"A Syrian migrant teen has demanded that all signs and products in Europe should be labelled in Arabic to make migrants feel more welcome. [Aras Bacho moved to Germany from Syria five years ago and while only 18 has become a regular columnist in migrant issues across German media.  “Of course everything in Europe should be in Arabic for refugees,” Bacho wrote in the German edition of The Huffington Post. Claiming that he finds it “sad” that many migrants can live in a country like Germany for years, or even decades, without ever learning German, he says that integration is difficult due to the language barrier. “I, as a refugee, think that inscriptions on street signs in Europe should be translated into Arabic. Equally,  food packaging should be in Arabic. It should also be possible to take tests in Arabic,” he wrote. According to Bacho, if everything were in Arabic then migrants who have passed their driving licence would find it easier to drive in Germany, they would “understand the law more quickly” and be able to enter the labour market if Germans spoke and wrote Arabic, rather than German. “We should help these people more. No matter what it costs,” he writes adding: “I think that Europe needs to establish the Arabic language. That would be very good for refugees. ” The comments made by Bacho echo calls by German academics who have suggested idea that German pupils should have mandatory Arabic classes until they finish school to better integrate new migrants. Professor of Computer Science Thomas Strothotte said such a move would make the migrants feel “more welcome”. Linguistics Professor Angelika Redder also agrees with the concept saying the government needs to push the issue. This commentary by Mr. Bacho is not the first time he has stirred controversy. In a column for Freitag Bacho took out his anger on “Wutbürgern”  a term for disaffected voters who protest against government policy, like members of the   PEGIDA movement, or Alternative for Germany (AfD) party supporters. Despite having only lived in Germany for five years he wrote: “We refugees and the Germans do not want to live in the same country with you Wutbürgern,” adding: “You also can, and I think this is right, flee from Germany. Please take Saxony and the AfD with you. ”"
2016-10-26,"’  ’ ”   Donald Trump on Tuesday called for an investigation into   President Barack Obama after hacked emails from Hillary Clinton   campaign chairman John Podesta, published by WikiLeaks,    Clinton’s use of a private email server. ” ’   In an interview  Trump called the revelation ”a   big thing.” ’ ’   ”This means that he has to be investigated,” Trump said. ’ ’   During a rally in Sanford, Florida, on Tuesday afternoon, Trump   addressed the latest emails. ’ ’   ”But newly public emails  —   WikiLeaks  —   prove otherwise,” he said   of Obama’’s knowledge of the private server Clinton used while she   was his secretary of state. ’ ’’ ’   The Republican presidential nominee said ”now I understand” why   Obama supported Clinton in the presidential election. ’ ’   ”Because he didn’’t want to get caught up in the big lie,” he   said. ”We have to investigate the investigation.

2016-10-27,"Gigi Hadid and Stuart Weitzman debuted a new line of boots on Tuesday, kicking off fall with a    hybrid that comes in metallic copper, silver or black   leather (for those who like an edge.) Don’t let the dressy boots fool you, though  —   they are surprisingly versatile. “I was always able to come up with the look for the shoe in my brain, but they were a bit harder to execute than clothing,” Hadid told Vogue. “These designs have the ability to go from sexy to sporty, and they have an agility to them, but a gracefulness at the same time. ” But Hadid isn’t all about glamour  —   the boots are for a good cause, too. To mark the collaboration, Weitzman and Pencils of Promise have partnered in an effort to promote accessible education in developing countries (Ghana, Guatemala and Laos). Naturally, Hadid and Weitzman  —   along with actor James Franco  —   pulled out all the stops in an   campaign video titled #DoItRight. Within 30 seconds, Hadid is laced up in her eponymous boots and taking swings at masked male models in a boxing ring.

2016-10-28,"Russia has lost its bid to become a member of the UN’s human rights council, in a defeat that reflects the diplomatic cost of its war in Syria. Russia was beaten on Friday by Hungary and Croatia in the competition for two seats on the council allotted to eastern European states. It was the first time one of the permanent five members of the security council had failed to get elected to the HRC since its formation a decade ago, and followed a campaign by human rights groups opposing Russian membership because of its role in the bombing of Syrian cities, eastern Aleppo in particular.  “They bomb a hospital one day, they run for the Human Rights Council the next. And they wonder why they missed the cut,” a western diplomat said. Vitaly Churkin, the Russian envoy, shrugged off the rebuff, saying the countries who beat Russia “are not as exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. ” “Russia is quite exposed,” Churkin said.  Human rights groups also campaigned against Saudi Arabia for the high civilian death toll of its bombing campaign in Yemen, but the kingdom won one of the four seats reserved for the   region. The   general assembly on Friday elected 14 members to the   council, the UN’s main body charged with promoting and protecting human rights. Brazil, China, Cuba, Egypt, Iraq, Japan, Rwanda, South Africa, Tunisia, the UK and the US were also elected to the council.  At the same time as Russia suffered its diplomatic setback, the Kremlin announced that president Vladimir Putin had turned down the Russian military’s demand to resume bombing of Aleppo, to keep open humanitarian corridors for rebels and civilians to leave the city.  “In rejecting Russia’s bid for   to the Human Rights Council, UN member states have sent a strong message to the Kremlin about its support for a regime that has perpetrated so much atrocity in Syria. It also shows how important it is to have competitive slates in UN elections,” Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, said.  “Countries should have a chance to reject those whose candidacies are so severely compromised, as they did today. We have already said that Saudi Arabia, which was   without competition, doesn’t belong on the council in light of its indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Yemen. We’ll be keeping all members’ rights records under the microscope while they’re on the council. Next year, UN member states should make sure that all regional groups have real competition so no one is guaranteed victory,” he said. Russia currently holds the presidency of the UN security council but has alienated many UN member states by its support for the Syrian regime’s airstrikes against   cities, and by its verbal attacks on UN officials who had criticised the airstrikes. On Thursday, Churkin shrugged off the findings of a UN investigation that the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons, saying the regime itself should have its own enquiry. “Russia deserves this defeat, but it will only increase Moscow’s contempt for the UN,” said Richard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council for Foreign Relations. “The Russians only really care about the security council anyway, and they may well respond by stirring up more trouble there over Syria or other crises. ” In 2001, the US was voted off the HRC’s predecessor, the UN Human Rights Commission, in a gesture of disapproval over the George Bush administration’s unilateralist leanings. "
2016-10-29,"How did you like the 15th century? Not so much? Too bad because syphilis is making a comeback. According to a new report issued last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there has been a spike in the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia and gonorrhea, but syphilis came out on top with a whopping 19 percent rise over just last year. The spike was felt most by young people ages 15 to 24. As usual, experts immediately looked at questions of public funding. Jonathan Mermin, director of the National Center for   Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for the CDC, told NPR that “more than half of state and local STD programs have experienced budget cuts . . . [and] our ability to prevent STDs is only as strong as the   infrastructure to support it. ” But there are likely other explanations for what’s going on here. Some experts have pointed to the “Tinder effect,” the idea that online hookup sites are making casual anonymous sex easier and more common than it used to be. It’s true that millennials generally are less likely to be sexually active in their 20s than previous generations and the age of first sexual intercourse has ticked upward in recent years, but it seems that the segment of the population who are having casual sex are having more of it and more of it anonymously.  author Nancy Jo Sales asked young people how Tinder is different from just going out to a bar. As one young man replied, “You could talk to two or three girls at a bar and pick the best one, or you can swipe a couple hundred people a day  —   the sample size is so much larger. It’s setting up two or three Tinder dates a week and, chances are, sleeping with all of them, so you could rack up 100 girls you’ve slept with in a year. ”   It’s always hard to persuade young people that they’re not invincible. But the threat of living with    diseases should help.  In 2015, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) put up billboards in California encouraging users of dating apps Tinder and Grindr to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases. Tinder responded with a letter demanding that the group take down the ads: “These unprovoked and wholly unsubstantiated accusations are made to irreparably damage Tinder’s reputation in an attempt to encourage others to take an HIV test offered by your organization,” the letter read. “While Tinder strongly supports such testing, the billboard’s statements are not founded upon any scientific evidence and are incapable of withstanding critical analysis. ” But earlier this year, Tinder added a locator for STD testing to its app. The problem with casual, anonymous sex via apps is twofold: You’re more likely to catch something from one out of 100 hookups, and you’re less likely to inform your former partners if you find out you have something. Indeed, you’re unlikely to ever encounter one of them in person ever again. But what about prevention? If you went to school in the ’90s, you were subject to an unending barrage of sex education  —   much of it devoted to preventing  . And the threat repeated by teachers,   workers and television ads was clear. As the Keith Haring poster put it, “Silence = Death. ” There were photos of cadavers and funerals, images of war and people in mourning. If you don’t use a condom, the message went, you’re signing your own death warrant. Chlamydia and gonorrhea just can’t compete. Sure, some sexually transmitted diseases can lead to infertility, but most effects of STDs can be cured with antibiotics. In other words, it is hard to put the fear of God in young people with these kinds of problems. As Josh Bloom of the American Council on Science and Health notes, drugs now allow   people to have unprotected sex without passing it on to uninfected partners. “And if they do, so what? You take a pill or two per day and live a mostly normal life. ” Bloom suggests that the rise in syphilis among gay men is “very good, albeit indirect, evidence that the reduced fear of HIV infection is a very important factor in driving up the rates of other STDs. ” How did you like the 15th century? Not so much? Too bad because syphilis is making a comeback. As for the rise in cases among young women, Kay Hymowitz of the Manhattan Institute notes, “Kids are a lot more afraid of getting pregnant than getting a disease that only needs a little cipro. ” Indeed, that may be one reason why teen pregnancy has continued to fall even as the rates of sexually transmitted diseases have risen. Young people may simply be using forms of protection other than condoms  —   IUDs have become more common.   pills have become more easily obtained from doctors and clinics and cheaper too. Young people can continue to protect against pregnancy even while not using prophylactics. But the effects of these STDs are not negligible. If left untreated, about 10 to 15 percent of women with chlamydia will develop pelvic inflammatory disease, according to the CDC, which can lead to infertility. Meanwhile, some new strains of gonorrhea have been detected that seem to be resistant to antibiotics. Syphilis is hard to detect because its symptoms look like a lot of other ailments. If untreated, it can remain latent in the body for years. In the late stages of syphilis, “The disease may damage the internal organs, including the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints. ” It’s always hard to persuade young people that they’re not invincible. But the threat of living with    diseases should help."
2016-10-30,"In a decision late Friday afternoon, U. S. District Judge Colleen   said she could ”reasonably infer the existence of a conspiracy” among American Airlines Group Inc ( ) Delta Air Lines Inc ( ) Southwest Airlines Co ( ) and United Continental Holdings Inc ( ) to fix prices.   who sits in Washington, D. C. did not rule on the merits of the proposed   case, which combines 105 lawsuits filed around the country and seeks triple damages. The U. S. Department of Justice last year began its own probe into a possible conspiracy among the airlines, which, according to government data, command a roughly   domestic market share. Passengers claimed that the conspiracy began in early 2009, and has resulted in higher fares and reduced flight choices. They said the conspiracy, together with low fuel prices and higher fees for checking bags and other services, helped the airlines post a record $21. 7 billion combined profit in 2015. The airlines said the litigation should be dismissed because there was no proof of an agreement to collude, or that they reduced capacity in tandem. But in her   decision,   pointed to statements by several airline executives about the need for ”discipline” in seating capacity. ”Starting in 2009, the industry experienced limited capacity growth,” the judge wrote. ”Notably, as defendants’ executives acknowledged, this restriction on growing capacity was a marked change within the industry. The court is satisfied that at this stage, plaintiffs sufficiently pled parallel conduct.”   said this was true even for Southwest, though its use of a single aircraft type and other factors gave it a ”limited ability” to reduce capacity. American spokesman Matt Miller called the plaintiffs’ claims ”plainly deficient,” and said the carrier is confident they will be found meritless. Delta had no immediate comment. Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins declined to comment. United did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Michael Hausfeld, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, called the decision a ”substantial victory” for passengers. ”We look forward to moving forward aggressively to secure the relief the public deserves,” he added.

2016-10-31,"Never mind a wet midweek test at Stoke City, this was a Halloween which ended with Swansea City given the lasting fright of a defeat that leaves them second bottom and five points from safety. For Stoke a third consecutive win lifts them to 12th position and suddenly they are looking up following a barren beginning. They made it nine points from nine thanks to a     from Alfie Mawson and Wilfried Bony’s second of the match. A pleased Mark Hughes was annoyed only at the yellow card Michael Oliver, the referee, gave Marko Arnautovic: “It’s the one frustration  —   he acknowledged that maybe he made a mistake [after the game]. But it doesn’t help us as it’s five yellows so Marko misses a game. “Our attacking play was really good. Any number of chances could have gone in but we got the job done. It was great to get a third straight win, enabling us to get into a position where we feel more comfortable. We do not feel like a team that belongs in the bottom half. It was important to win and get into that middle group and we now have the same amount of points we had at this stage last season. ” The Swansea manager, Bob Bradley, was, to his credit, honest following a third match in charge without a victory. “It’s a huge job, I knew that from the start,” he said. “When there’s a change it’s because things haven’t gone well. You come in, look at fixtures lying ahead and it’s not like you do it with guarantees of points. You win games with some combination of your football and mentality. I don’t think we were good enough in either category. ” Hughes’s men took the lead after three minutes as Bony finally opened his account for Stoke in an eighth appearance. In fact, it was his first goal for anyone since Boxing Day. A Xherdan Shaqiri corner found Joe Allen, the playmaker miscued and, when the ball came to Bony, he stabbed home to score against his former club. Before   Bradley had offered   comments about players’ musical taste  —   none has heard Bruce Springsteen or U2, apparently  —   but there was nothing amusing for him in the awful defending that led to the opening goal. Within five minutes he could smile again, though. This time Phil Bardsley was the culprit. Despite seeming to try to throw the smaller Wayne Routledge to the ground, the   was unable to stop him heading past Lee Grant after Gylfi Sigurdsson’s clever piece of skill had created the opening for an expert cross. Bony came close to adding his and Stoke’s second moments later with a shot that required a Taylor deflection to go wide. After a lull in play Charlie Adam clipped Lukasz Fabianski’s left post. Later there was a slick move that went from Taylor to Llorente to Sigurdsson, though the Icelander’s effort went for a corner that came to nothing. The quality then dipped. Passes went astray, punts were hoofed away and there were gaps in each team’s shape. Adam again hit the upright  —   this time the right one  —   with another fine curling effort but when an Arnautovic   went miles wide it summed up how the first half was going until a superb moment from Allen. Collecting the ball inside Swansea’s half, the    let go a slide rule pass that pierced the visiting rearguard and played in Arnautovic. The Austrian rounded Fabianski yet once again Stoke were denied by a post. As the interval approached another neat Llorente   found Routledge and the    stung Grant’s fingers. Given the space each team had enjoyed the   messages from Hughes and Bradley may have been similar: tighten up and keep hunting and chances should come. If so, the Welshman will have been heartened when Bony received a clear view of Fabianski’s goal and the American relieved when the Ivorian ultimately blazed over. Stoke provided a mirror image of their start to the opening half. They peppered Swansea and finally took the lead again. Ramadan Sobhi, a    Egyptian who replaced Shaqiri  —   who had a tight hamstring  —   on 26 minutes, danced along the left then banged the ball across goal and it went in off the unfortunate Mawson. That came 10 minutes into the second period and it prompted Bradley to make a move soon afterwards when he took off the ineffective Modou Barrow for Bastón. The    took up Barrow’s berth along his side’s left. It was from the opposite flank, though, that Routledge, who along with Sigurdsson was Swansea’s best performer, gave Stoke a scare. The winger ducked and dived, then skated into the area before he was finally halted by the home defence. Then came the grandstand finish from Stoke as Bony’s headed finish from Allen’s improvised cross made this a happy closing day of October for them."
2016-11-01,"Why is PayPal   and venture capitalist Peter Thiel backing Donald Trump for president? After listening to Thiel explain his position at the National Press Club on Monday, one might conclude that it has much to do with the eccentric billionaire’s dark obsession with bubbles. Trump, Clinton, and Emails: The Latest Election Updates, Immigration bubbles, housing bubbles, dotcom bubbles, stock bubbles, trade bubbles, war bubbles —  Thiel hates them all, considers them downright “catastrophic. ” As such, he is frustrated by the foolish compulsion of Americans (especially Baby Boomers) to again and again “buy into” the rosy promise of bubbles. “Whenever there is a hard problem, people want to believe in an easy solution,” he lamented. They “deny reality,” and soon another bubble begins to “inflate. ” Most politicians foster a bubble mentality, charged Thiel, by peddling “falsely reassuring stories. ” But Trump is different. He’s not one of those    elites insisting “everything is fine. ” He doesn’t think “optimism alone without hard work” can fix the U. S. Rather, Trump can “viscerally feel the decline” and, in response, is pioneering “a new American politics that overcomes denial, rejects bubble thinking, and reckons with reality. ” Condensed version: The   Thiel has long argued that the U. S. has been on the skids since the 1970s, so Trump’s message of     strikes him as pure genius. Few   Trumpkins have prompted as much bewilderment and turmoil as Thiel. His headline speech at the Republican nominating convention was weird enough. But then in   he announced he was giving $1. 25 million to the Trump cause. Not a huge sum by the standards of   donors, but enough to send Silicon Valley into a flurry of How could hes! and No he did nots! Admittedly, Thiel has always been an odd bird, with his passion for, as he called them Monday, “fringy” causes (seasteading,   measures, the development of a   artificial superintelligence somewhat creepily known as The Singularity  …    ). And Thiel’s libertarian political leanings led him to back the decidedly fringy Ron Paul in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential races. But to actually provide material aid to Donald Trump in all his     misogynistic, sexually predatory, religiously bigoted vulgarity? That was beyond the pale for many in the   Bay    to mention the   Silicon Valley. There were immediate calls from within tech world for companies to sever ties with Thiel. Both Facebook (on whose board he sits) and Y Combinator (with whom he is a   partner) felt compelled to defend their continued relationship with him. At the press club, Thiel downplayed the drama, even as he voiced surprise at “the pushback. ” He allowed, “I really didn’t think that there would be this sort of visceral reaction. ” Maybe. But from what we’ve seen and heard from Thiel, one gets the feeling that Trump’s gift for provoking outrage is central to the nominee’s appeal for his fellow billionaire. Like Trump, Thiel himself takes great pride in being a disruptive force. He favors revolutionary ideas and people with big plans for blowing things up and remaking the world. (His foundation even set up a   body aimed at turning “wild ideas into   technologies. ”) He loves to slam Silicon Valley for thinking small. (A Twitter critic, one of his pet quotes is, “We wanted flying cars, and instead what we got was 140 characters. ”) And in 2010 he established a fellowship to provide $2 million in grants to urge young entrepreneurs to quit college and start their own enterprises. Also like Trump, Thiel loves to grump about multiculturalism and political correctness. (He in fact wrote an entire book on “The Diversity Myth”). He seems to feel strangely vindicated by the abuse he is taking over Trump. Early in his prepared remarks (which ran about 15 minutes) Thiel mentioned that the   publication The Advocate, which had once praised him as a gay innovator, was now asserting that in fundamental ways he is “not a gay man. ” He informed the assembled journalists, “The lie behind the buzzword of diversity could not be made more clear. If you don’t conform, then you don’t count as diverse, no matter what your personal background. ” And, of course, like Trump, Thiel likes to play hardball with the media: After years of warring with the gossip site Gawker (which kinda, sorta outed Thiel in 2007) the billionaire secretly bankrolled the     privacy lawsuit that bankrupted the site. In his speech, Thiel called Gawker “a singularly sociopathic bully. ” On a gut level, in other words, Trump and Thiel seem made for each other in many ways. Unless, that is, you start really thinking about Thiel’s professed horror of slick,    politicians who assure voters they have simple solutions to the nation’s complex problems. Simplistic ideas like, say, “build a wall,” or  “ban all Muslims,” or, more fundamentally, Trump’s message that voters need only to put their faith in him because he is “the only one who can fix this. ” Looked at this way, Trumpism may be the biggest bubble to hit the body politic in decades. And when it inevitably pops, this time Thiel will be as much to blame for the resulting catastrophe as anyone."
2016-11-02,"The fateful explosion that shut down America’s only permanent   storage site happened on Valentine’s Day 2014. The facility, called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant or WIPP, is a series of salt caverns 2, 000 feet below the New Mexican desert. Radioactive waste from U. S.’s nuclear weapons comes to WIPP, drum by drum, to be entombed underground. One such drum ruptured on that February evening. Radioactive material spewed through the caverns, some of it leaking aboveground as well. The original cause turned out to be downright comical: Contractors packing the drum at Los Alamos National Laboratory used the wrong type of cat litter —    rather than clay —  to soak up the liquid radioactive waste, which then reacted with other chemicals inside the drum to explode. Yes, cat litter. WIPP has been closed for cleanup since the accident, and it’s since blown past one deadline to reopen. The Department of Energy, which operates the plant, is now working to ready WIPP by December 2016. In anticipation of WIPP resuming operations, the energy department recently filed for a permit to build temporary storage aboveground. The plan would add several concrete vaults to hold the waste drums, designed to be tornado and earthquake proof. More   storage would give WIPP a buffer if, for example, the caverns have to ever be temporarily closed for maintenance. But the plan is already drawing criticism from the community. “There’s nothing inherently wrong with having some buffer storage,” says Greg Mello, executive director of the Los Alamos Study Group, a nonprofit that works on nuclear issues in New Mexico. “But the management of this waste program has hardly been stellar. ” The accidents exposed lapses in the handling of nuclear waste at WIPP. But the subsequent cleanup hasn’t inspired much confidence either. In August, the federal watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office, chided the DOE for an unrealistic cleanup plan, noting that the DOE had a “less than one percent chance” of meeting its original deadline. In fact, the report went on to read, “DOE has a history of exceeding its cost and schedule estimates and then creating new baselines. ” The   cost of the accident, according to a LA Times analysis, could top $2 billion. And to think, just a few years ago, WIPP was a relative bright spot in the U. S.’s dysfunctional nuclear waste disposal plan. Zooming out, the problem is much bigger than just WIPP. Making of the country’s nuclear warheads created tons of radioactive waste, which has nowhere to go. The original plan, drawn up decades up, was to send   transuranic waste like gloves and tools used to handle plutonium and uranium to WIPP, where salt caverns are supposed to eventually collapse and entomb the material.   radioactive waste, like spent reactor fuel, would be buried even deeper underground at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. WIPP opened 1999, but Yucca Mountain hasn’t even been built. And it’s unclear it ever will due to political opposition in Nevada. So instead,   radioactive waste sat at the old factories where it was produced during the Cold War —  especially at Hanford in Washington and Savannah River in South Carolina. Those tanks and storage facilities were never designed to hold   waste for so long. The sites suffered from leaks and environmental contamination. And the cleanup efforts at Hanford and Savannah River are dogged by their own delays and cost overruns. (The report was not kidding around when it called criticized the DOE for a “history of exceeding its cost and schedule estimates. ”) Since a repository at Yucca Mountain doesn’t exist, there is sometimes talk of sending this   waste to WIPP, which was designed to only handle   waste. So in this world of mission creep for storage sites, where temporary storage becomes indefinite, New Mexicans are not eager to add more aboveground storage to WIPP. Adding more storage also adds another layer of complexity to the handling of nuclear waste. “Workers have to handle these containers more, so you have more risk of accidental release,” says Don Hancock, director of the nuclear waste safety program at the Southwest Research and Information Center and a longtime critic of WIPP. Hancock would prefer the waste never come to WIPP, staying put at the locations where it already is. The DOE’s application for aboveground storage is now in the hands of New Mexico’s environment department. Public comment is open until December. In this light, the breakdown of trust in the site’s management could make it harder to get new construction improved, which could in turn make it harder for the site to operate efficiently, and so on and back and forth. This aboveground storage plan is just the latest in the    between a national agency and the local community. Whatever one’s personal opinion of nuclear weapons, Americans have all benefited from living in a country whose military might is backed by those weapons. But the costs of producing them has fallen disproportionately on specific locations —  at Hanford and Savannah River and now at the sites where the waste is stored. The waste has to be go somewhere, but where?  And who will want it if the government can’t promise to get it right?"
2016-11-03," Canadian work permits for highly skilled workers from the United States jumped in the first half as companies lured applicants with the country’s calm political climate in the face of a raucous U. S. election. Canadian immigration data showed new work permits issued to U. S. residents jumped 53. 8 percent in the first eight months of 2016 from the same period last year, though renewals were down. Some companies see the heated U. S. presidential race between Democratic party candidate Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival Donald Trump as an opportunity to lure Americans to Canada, which has a stereotypical reputation for politeness.  Trump has called the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico one of the worst deals ever struck and blames it for manufacturing jobs being moved to Mexico. He has also pledged to build a wall on the border with Mexico to deter illegal immigration.  Clinton has offered a more tempered approach, saying she would seek to   NAFTA if elected. ”We ran a huge ad campaign in the States, targeting expats, Americans   and it generated a lot of interest,” said Christopher Reid, founder of   software developer Sortable. ”We used Trump as an anchoring point.” The ads, which ran in March and June, include one that featured a photo of Trump along with the message: ”Are you thinking of moving to Canada?” Reid said he found two candidates he wants to hire. Heather Galt, vice president of talent initiatives at Canadian business incubator Communitech, said politics usually comes up when she talks to U. S. job candidates. ”There is extra momentum right now . .. that new appreciation for the values that Canada has around diversity and inclusion,” Galt added. Separate government data also showed permits for international students looking to attend Canadian schools jumped in the first quarter to 42, 737, up 42 percent from a year earlier. In the second quarter, student permits jumped 63 percent, to 56, 329. While the government doesn’t ask why students choose Canada, consulting firm Intead, which advises postsecondary institutions looking to recruit international students, warned in June that a Trump win could hit U. S. enrollment numbers.     In a survey conducted last winter, 60 percent of potential international students said they would be less likely to study in the United States if Trump was elected.  Latin American students were especially concerned, and nearly 80 percent of Mexican students surveyed said they would be less likely to study in the country if Trump was president. ”Canada is a very attractive destination, it’s tolerant, it’s very diverse which is appealing to international students, it’s stable, it’s safe,” said Richard Levin, executive director of enrolment services at the University of Toronto.

2016-11-04,"If you use Facebook, or Twitter, have a   connection, watch television or have been to an office Halloween party, you’ve probably encountered them: internet memes. These shareable, sometimes pithy and often puerile units of culture have emerged as the lingua franca of the 2016 election, and have given the American people an entirely new way of articulating their beliefs. Clinton’s top tweet is a meme. Trump’s taco bowl became one. Through memes, Ted Cruz was “unmasked” as the Zodiac killer. Jeb Bush’s limp plea for applause got him Vined into oblivion. Bernie Sanders shared a moment with a bird that blossomed into something out of Walt Disney’s   Marxist phase. Memes can be fun, or they can be dumb  —   but as an emerging medium, they haven’t provoked a lot of debate or analysis. In fact, they seem to defy scrutiny. And slowly, before anyone can even take note, memes are ruining democracy. Memes  —   from the Greek for “that which is imitated”  —   were once defined as being   units of culture. This included anything that could be learned, remembered and spread from one brain to another, such as the concept of god all the way to the popular Budweiser “Wazzup” catchphrase. Through the internet, the idea moved from the conceptual sphere into the viscous reality of data and pixels, transforming it into something more traceable: a segment of media that is copied rapidly. This includes images, text, video, a combination of all three and sometimes   actions. Political memes have always existed. Recall Ronald Reagan’s Welfare Queen or Howard Dean’s euphoric howl. And of course, more recently, we had Yes We Can.  What’s novel here is an inversion of control  —   political memes are no longer rare flashes of uncensored personality or intensely manicured visual messages. They are now born from the swamps of the internet in real time, distributed from the bottom up. They have grown into a form of anarchic folk propaganda, ranging from tolerable epigrams to glittering   image macros akin to a million little rogue Pravdas. Like me, you probably have more than a few Facebook friends who make it their life’s work to circulate political memes in hopes of influencing how you see the world. They are our deadbeat uncles, former   and   high school acquaintances. They are agents of nowhere, apparatchiks of nothing in particular. And through the raw power of mass replication, even their most insipid ideas are able to surface from below. By typing some text on an image and sharing it with friends, they too have a voice capable of reaching a critical mass. The reason why it is now possible for Darryl from Accounting who hates “social justice warriors” to have the same communicative power as a television network is down to the DNA of the medium: speed and lack of gatekeepers. Memes thrive on a lack of information  —   the faster you can grasp the point, the higher the chance it will spread.  They also favor extreme perspectives: a recent study from Texas University found that individuals who are socially isolated and more likely to be characterized as “on the fringe” have a greater chance at creating a successful meme. In order to grasp why this is so significant, we need to go back to the last time we were making similarly grandiose proclamations about how the internet changed everything. Picture yourself in the year 2010.  The possibility of the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series is as depressingly remote as ever. Barack Obama still has that new car smell and is being hailed as the first “internet president”. The world is awash in a fresh wave of   optimism and the Middle East’s Twitter revolts have yet to burn to a cinder. It was a more innocent time, when Uber and AirBnB were still known as Ubercab and Airbed and Breakfast and neither had been blamed for homelessness, unemployment and the wholesale destruction of the working class yet. I was a staff writer at Adbusters Magazine at the time  —   a radical,   magazine based out of Vancouver, British Columbia, that bills itself as the journal of the mental environment and got famous off their 1990s “subvertisements”. The art director, a few graphic designers and myself would often spend long nights in the office drinking beer and churning out content to fill the spaces that would be traditionally used for advertisements. We created memes, but not just any memes  —   political ones meant to trigger paradigm shifts that would upend the prevailing logic of late capitalism, such as this one: We called it “meme warfare” a term that was originally coined by social change activist Andrew Boyd.  “Social movements cannot live by meme alone. Yet memes are clearly powerful  —  both analytically and operationally,” Boyd wrote in his essay Truth is a Virus: Meme warfare and the billionaires for Bush (or Gore). “A vital movement requires a hot and happening meme. Truth is a virus whose aim is to subvert the corporate mememachine with a sly guerrilla war of signs. ” Much of what we produced was mischievous, maybe even poignant, much of it verged on   but most of it was strictly for the LOLs   to keep the blood pumping through those long and sedentary   production nights. But every once in a while, the Adbusters office turned out something that proved to be profoundly effective.  For instance, the black and white image of a ballerina gracefully perched atop the charging bull of Wall Street, while masked figures charged forward from the background. “Bring tent” it read underneath, alongside the now famous hashtag that sparked the Occupy movement. Back in 2010, the idea of using memes to political ends was still housed within a fairly slim   corridor  —   it was a tool that seemed entirely of our own creation, and entirely under our control. We viewed memes as a vehicle through which activists could speak truth to power  —   they were molotov Jpegs to be thrown at corporate hegemony’s bulletproof limousine. Never in our most ironic dreams did we the think that the spirit of our tired,   pisstakes would end up leading to a resurgence of white nationalism and make the prospect of a fascist America faintly realistic. But the internet is weird like that. It takes things and twists them. At their most basic, meme warfare presented an opportunity for individuals to seize control of the means of media production from corporate interests. It was a viral and   medium that would allow individuals to compete for attention against the   hydra of advertising, marketing and public relations.  This line of thinking was, in retrospect, breathtakingly naive. It assumed that the act of meme generation by a   entity would be innately good. Like many instances of the   idealism, it would unravel in spectacular fashion. It’s not that   activists were wrong about how the internet could be leveraged to change politics  —   it’s that they were terribly right. There isn’t a straight, causal line connecting the Occupy movement and its many slogans with the   image macros that have been frogmarched out of 4chan to spread hate across the internet in support of Donald Trump. But they share some conceptual DNA. They are both indebted to Guy Debord and the Situationists, specifically the practice of détournement: hijacking expressions of the capitalist system and its media culture against itself. They both also share a deep cynicism about the mainstream media. But this is where the similarities end. When appropriated by the emerging   memes become a different weapon. They call it “meme magic”  —   a phenomenon which has helped vocalize and activate the more extreme wings of the Trump base and introduce white nationalism to a new generation of disaffected nerds. Meme magic is almost identical to meme warfare in that it attempts to use shareable images and ideas in an effort to engender real political change.  To date, their most effective memes have been those questioning Hillary Clinton’s health status. Google image search “Zombie Hillary” or “Hillary Short Circuit” and you’ll be treated to a series of imagery made up of equal parts blood and robotics. As explained by Andrew Anglin, publisher of The Daily Stormer, a     blog, meme magic “comprises not only an attempt, but a successful attempt, to formulate a new culture for ourselves, separate from the mainstream culture, which is largely the result of Jewish social imperialism”. In a   landscape where distrust of the media has gone mainstream,    propagandists like Anglin are able to resonate with an audience because they trade in the allure of dark fantasies that appeal to alienated young white men. When the activist left decried corporate control over media, its strongest arguments leaned heavy on   reasoning. Noam Chomsky’s Manufacturing Consent instantly comes to mind, in which he painstakingly examines the New York Times’ coverage of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. The   on the other hand, is far less interested in thoughtful critiques and far more concerned with control. This mirrors the classic   divide of analysis versus action. While the left is typically comfortable with endlessly analyzing what’s wrong with the reality, the right seeks to impose their own reality, currently existing reality be damned. Traditionally, mass media have provided a protective membrane between the public and overly toxic ideas. The mass effect of this delivered a relatively standardized view of politics and world events. For a number of reasons  —   a   lowering of journalistic standards, the deterministic effect of ratings and clicks, and the generalized paranoia created by the internet, to name a few  —   this membrane has broken down. The recent #draftourdaughters meme provides an instructional example. On 16 May of this year, Hillary Clinton voiced support for legislation that would require women to register for the draft. This was largely received as a rare instance a bipartisan support for a purely symbolic gesture, aimed at promoting gender equality in the military. For a maverick like Ted Cruz, it was a chance for him to put on his daddy hat, lambasting the bill because it would “forcibly conscript young girls into combat”. To the paranoiac mind it fed into a conspiracy theory that the next world war is imminent. For the   it was a perfect opportunity to launch a “  persuasion” campaign. The result has been a series of widely shared fake campaign ads meant to promote the idea that Hillary wanted to send young women to their deaths in a war against Russia. The imagery had a distinctly feminist flavour, with slogans like “He died for his country. Now, it’s her turn” and “Men make up 97% of combat deaths. It’s time to end the combat gap. ” Those orchestrating the campaign instructed their followers to “Remind folks when they say it’s fake   …     It’s real”. Perhaps this is all a just a garbage mirage brought about by this election cycle’s  . But regardless of their   viability as a fringe pantomime, those meme creators are at the vanguard of a broad directional trend, and seem to be exploiting it with some measure of success. Irrespective of your personal political leanings, for anyone who thinks sensible dialogue is a critical component to a functioning democracy, there is a large problem to solve here.  In his 1946 essay Politics and the English language, which scrutinized the connection between ideology and the proliferation of empty language, George Orwell said: Political language  —   and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists  —   is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. We face a similar challenge, albeit one that is punctuated with reaction gifs. If you look at the latest iOS keyboard update, complete with a massive repository of looping imagery, we can see how intimately memes have meshed with language, and how we face a far more daunting challenge than Orwell ever did. The tools we use to communicate are becoming counterproductive to actual communication. It’s only getting easier to spread lies and respond with shrugs. The internet has become an endless theatre of virtual conflict, one in which we are all either willing or oblivious participants, and like it or not, it is on this battlefield that the nature of our reality will probably be decided. There’s no clear answer to this dilemma save for one basic fact: those who value truth desperately need to find a way to make the truth more plausible."
2016-11-05,"We are at a crossroads.  Every vote matters. Never, in my lifetime has there been so much division, so much hostility, so much frustration, so much blatant bias and so much lingering confusion. As a college educated woman, I represent the demographic that is supposedly the swing vote in this election. As a   Christian conservative, the choice for me is very clear but I realize the choice is not as clear to those who remain undecided. So it is to the undecided, particularly women and people of faith, I offer the following as guideposts to better discern how to make a wise and thoughtful decision. There is no perfect candidate, and the media magnifies their flaws. For some, the choice is for the lesser of two evils, because of their personalities instead of their vision.   Supporting Mr. Trump for president does not mean I have ignored his past or indefensible comments, but I do accept his apologies. I completely understand why some women would still be undecided.  Each candidate has a distinctly different philosophy of the role of government and the issues we face. Secretary Clinton is a   leaning Democrat and a refined career politician representing the political establishment. Mr. Trump is a successful business man, an outsider who speaks his mind and who often wears his emotions on his sleeve. Supporting Mr. Trump for president does not mean I have ignored his past or indefensible comments, but I do accept his apologies. I completely understand why some women would still be undecided.  See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → These issues are personal to me. I survived childhood sexual abuse and a date rape at age 22. As President of Enough Is Enough for the last 23 years, I have been on the frontlines fighting to prevent the sexual exploitation of children and women, fighting to stop the pornification of our culture, and fighting to curb sexual predation. However when I met Mr. Trump two years ago at CPAC, he was a kind and gracious gentlemen. He applauded me in front of a crowd of people for taking the high road during the 1987 presidential scandal. He had not yet announced his presidency, but he told me that he had to run.  I immediately saw his passion for America, the conviction in his eyes, and a fire in his belly that was driving him to run in spite of the cost.  God is in the business of using flawed people who He humbled and molded into great leaders. Our country is framed by our Constitution as one nation, under God. I believe the philosophy of Mr. Trump and Governor Pence most closely mirrors a government for the people and by the people. President Reagan said it best over 50 years ago, ’The issue of this election is whether we believe in our capacity for   or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a   capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them for ourselves. ”  Our parties themselves represent two distinctive worldviews.  We as Christians must closely examine each party platform to discover which position best line up with our   worldview and the Word of God.   One of the most important and unavoidable issues is the issue of life. Abortion on demand is one of the great scourges on our nation.   I strongly believe that our Founders’ intent when writing the Declaration of Independence that all of humankind are endowed by their Creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, meant from womb to  tomb.   The   ticket stands strong on so many of these issues that truly matter, from Israel to a prosperous thriving economy. I believe that they will lead America forward, and best solve the challenges of a failed economy, inexcusable unemployment, a broken immigration system, an unfair tax system, corruption in politics, unfavorable trade deals, shaky foreign policy, failed Obamacare, out of control national debt and a diminished military which must be strengthened in order to defend against radical Islamists terrorists and terrorist nations who have declared war on America and our ally Israel. As CEO of Enough Is Enough (EIE) I also view Internet safety as a key issue since it’s the 4th ranked health concern for U. S. children. This summer, as the “law and order” candidate, Donald Trump signed The Children’s Internet Safety Presidential Pledge, developed by EIE. The Pledge was sent to all Presidential Candidates, calling upon them, if elected President to make a pledge to defend the innocence and dignity of America’s children by enforcing the existing federal laws and advancing public policies designed to prevent the sexual exploitation of children online and to make the Internet safer for all. In all fairness to Secretary Clinton, she sent a letter supporting the goals of the Pledge which is encouraging. In addition, I am encouraged that Mr. Trump has chosen a solid group of conservative, principled and talented leaders to serve by his side during his campaign. He has assembled an evangelical advisory council of top Christian leaders who are advising him on key issues and, he is listening. Most of these people are not part of the political elite. We are not only voting for President and VP but we are in effect voting for over 7000 political appointees and individuals who will serve in his administration. In a recent article, Mariam Bell wrote: “We vote FOR the 4, 000+ political appointees who will run all the agencies, departments and programs. We vote FOR the 3, 000+ appointments to boards and commissions the next president will make. We FOR all those 300+ who will be appointed to the judiciary, including the Supreme Court  —   whose rulings will impact our country for the next fifty years, not just four. The next president will appoint a cabinet and has already selected a vice president. ” Finally it is perhaps the most crucial of all considerations for the voter. The President serves for only   years, a Supreme Court Justice serves for life with the average term being 30 years. Our next President will likely appoint at least 3 justices, who will determine the trajectory of our Nation for generations to come. Mr. Trump has committed to appoint   constitutionalist judges like Antonin Scalia. Secretary Clinton on the other hand said she would appoint   judges, claiming, “I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women’s rights to make their own health care decisions. ” Code for I will not defend the sanctity of life for unborn Americans. Former Attorney General Ed Meese said in a speech to the Federalist Society that “An activist jurisprudence, one which anchors the Constitution only in the consciences of jurists  …    . is a chameleon jurisprudence, changing color and form in each era. ” He also said that a true approach “must respect the Constitution in all its parts and be faithful to the Constitution in its entirety. ” Trump and Pence agree, and so do I. Responsible citizens must vote. Every vote matters. It cannot be wasted. In the famous words of John F. Kennedy, ask not, what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. ” Start by voting!

2016-11-06," Afghan Taliban militants have strengthened their grip on lucrative illegal mining operations in the north of the country, as security forces focus most of their efforts on battling the insurgency in the volatile south, officials said. Abuses by local commanders with private militias and beyond the purview of central government have also driven people into the hands of Islamist fighters, the officials added, making it easier for them to profit from   mines in the region. ”The Taliban provide protection for the villagers to mine and the people are happy to do it despite the fact that there’s a presidential decree banning any uncontrolled mining,” said Gul Mohammad Bedar, deputy governor of Badakhshan province. He estimated that the militant group, fighting to overthrow the   government in Kabul, raised about a third of its funding needs in Badakhshan from deposits of minerals, including   lapis lazuli, found in its mountains. Opium, grown mainly in the south of Afghanistan, is by far the biggest source of revenue for the Taliban nationwide, with the total value of opiates reaching as much as around $  billion annually, according to the United Nations. Mining, by comparison, is worth several tens of millions of dollars a year, although that proportion rises in the north. Insurgents have taken authorities by surprise in the last year or so by seizing large swathes of territory in a part of the country where their presence has traditionally been weaker. ”We always thought that since much of the north, especially Badakhshan, Takhar and even parts of Kunduz, were   we would be fine and the militants would never be able to gain ground, but we were wrong,” said one Afghan security official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Last month’s attack on Kunduz, the city that the Taliban briefly seized last year, underlined the movement’s growing strength in the north and the problems the government has had in enforcing its authority even in a traditional stronghold. The grip the Taliban still holds on surrounding area was underlined last week by a raid by Afghan and U. S. forces on a nearby village in which two Americans died. More than 30 civilians, half of them children, were killed in an air strike called in to protect the troops, and the commander of U. S. forces in Afghanistan has promised an investigation. MINES THERE ”FOR US” Lack of security and infrastructure has meant mine reserves in Afghanistan remain largely untapped, and up to 10, 000 deposits are estimated to be outside government control. Most being exploited are small, artisanal operations. ”I have been digging mines, especially lapis, for years,” said Mohammad Zahir, a farmer in the Mahdan area of Keran Munjan district in Badakhshan. ”These mines are created by our Allah for us to dig and feed our families and it is not the property of the government or others.” As well as lapis lazuli, a   blue stone mined for thousands of years in the region, gold mines and emeralds in Raghestan and Keran Munjan districts have grown in importance over recent years, according to Bedar. The country also boasts major deposits of industrial metals, including the huge Mes Aynak copper deposit in Logar province near Kabul that is valued at $3 billion. But security concerns and the shortage of roads and railways mean the Chinese company that bid to develop it has yet to start production nine years after winning the contract. LOCALS ”INVITE TALIBAN BACK” Afghanistan is estimated to contain mineral deposits worth $  trillion, including gemstones and precious metals, copper, marble and iron ore. Much of it is in remote northern regions like Badakhshan, where Taliban revenue collectors have moved in, working with smugglers to ship stones out of Afghanistan for processing. Allowing the Taliban to boost its revenues has given them a financial base to expand operations in the north, where government control outside the main district and provincial centers is minimal. Maheullah Noori, a spokesman for the ministry of mines, said the government had no official estimate of the amount raised by insurgents from mining, but local MP Safiullah Muslim said the figure ran into millions of dollars a month. ”Gold, emeralds, rubies, and amethyst are all illegally mined by local militiamen and the Taliban who profit by hundreds of millions of afghanis monthly,” he said. Shir Aziz Kamawal, commander of police for the northern zone, said abuses by local strongmen had encouraged some local villages to work with the Taliban instead. ”Now that the Taliban are there, they have been looking into funding their fighting and digging mines.” For much of the past two years, as Afghan forces fought largely alone following the withdrawal of foreign combat troops at the end of 2014, the strategic focus has been on southern provinces like Helmand, a Taliban heartland and source of much of the country’s opium. But in the north as well, local officials said it would be difficult to restore trust in Kabul’s authority. Abdullah Naji, a member of Badakhshan’s local provincial council, said there had been two recent operations by Afghan forces to push the Taliban back, but security forces struggled to hold areas they captured, and insurgents soon returned. ”The local people invited them back because it is good business.” ($1 = 65. 74 afghanis)  (Additional reporting by Sardar Razmal and Hamid Shalizi; writing by James Mackenzie; Editing by Mike  ) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ”declaration of war” which could trigger clashes within days.

2016-11-07," As the candidates make their closing arguments before Election Day, millions of Americans have already cast their ballots for the presidential election.    At least 42 million citizens have voted early, with more than 18 million ballots cast in battleground states. This is a bit of a   from 2012, when 46 million people voted early. Since early voting is a sign of enthusiasm for the candidates, it’s an indication that fewer voters were motivated to get to the polls early  —   perhaps due to the unpopularity of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  So far, this what we know from early voting results: More women have voted than men, Latino voter turnout is so far at an   high, and black voter turnout is still below the last presidential election, when Barack Obama was on the ballot.  The results are a mixed bag for Clinton and Trump, and as I have reported throughout, it’s tough to draw conclusions from early voting numbers  —   different states have different early voting laws and report ballot returns inconsistently, and drawing conclusions based on party affiliation is fallible at best.     But on a bigger scale, the early voting returns still seem to be following national polling: It’s a tighter race than Clinton would have hoped for, but there are some positive signs for the Democratic nominee going into Election Day.    It’s another big year for the minority vote  —   this time for Latinos As my colleague Dara Lind writes, early voting has made a “serious case that the Latino ‘sleeping giant’ is finally rustling awake. ” And it’s happening in a big way:  In Arizona, Latinos have gone from 11 percent of the early voting electorate in 2012 to 13 percent this year. In Texas, Latino early voting rose 26 percent. In Florida, 152 percent. In North Carolina, an increase in early voting among Latinos in the face of restrictions has helped keep Democratic hopes alive in the state. In Nevada, a surge in the last few days of early voting made the state, according to state politics expert Jon Ralston, all but unwinnable for Republicans.     It’s a good sign for Clinton: When the early voting periods were about to open, University of Florida early voting expert Michael McDonald told CNBC, ”There is speculation that Trump’s rhetoric could entice Hispanics to vote against him, and there is some evidence in polls that Hispanic voting enthusiasm is running higher than normal.” His prediction has seemingly come to fruition, and it’s bad news for Trump in Florida, a state the Republican nominee cannot afford to lose. The Clinton campaign is hoping the surge in Latino voting will counteract what has been a small decline in the black vote in states like North Carolina  —   as well as Clinton’s terrible numbers among    whites.     Initial alarm bells over Clinton’s alleged “black voter problem” went off last week in Florida, where African Americans were slower to turn out than in the past two elections. It’s not particularly surprising that Clinton’s early black voter turnout numbers weren’t matching Obama’s. But results have drastically improved, since those earlier reports  —   University of Florida early voting expert Daniel Smith called it “old news” at this point, projecting that total black voter turnout in Florida will actually be higher in 2016 than it was in 2012.   Total black turnout in Florida in 2016 will be higher than 2012.  Mark it. At 777k as of yesterday. Souls to polls today. VBM & ED to come —   daniel a. smith (@electionsmith) November 7, 2016    That’s not the case in North Carolina, however, which has seen an 8. 7 percent decline  —   about 66, 000 votes  —   in black voter turnout, much of which has been attributed to more restrictive early voting rules, including earlier poll closures. Trump and Clinton seem to be close to a dead heat in North Carolina, but a breakdown of the Obama coalition is a better sign for Trump.  Even so, Clinton’s overall strength on the electoral map may prove to hold her up, and while polls remain tight in states like Nevada, Clinton has also been able to grow a substantial margin in early voting  —   Democrats are up 6 points  —   which could prove to be a firewall come Election Day. Early voting is a good measure of enthusiasm Early voting is usually a good measure of enthusiasm; lots of early voters means lots of decided voters. And while there doesn’t seem to be much enthusiasm for either candidate this year, there is some speculation that people voting against the opposing candidate rather than affirmatively voting for their candidate might bring people to the polls.    Paul Gronke, director of the Early Voting Information Center and a professor of political science at Reed College, said this could play out among the minority vote. ”Trump continues to make statements that alienate   voters, and he struggles to get beyond 2 percent in some state polls. Under that circumstance, and faced with a   Democratic [   ] machine, why would   voters wait?” he told me in September, noting that Trump also doesn’t seem to have much of an early voter   operation, which has been effective in getting out the Republican vote. It is also an effective way to show the campaigns where to focus their day of     resources. And that could make the difference with some demographics. According to a recent poll from the African American Research Collaborative, black voters do recognize the stakes of the election. And while they are not as enthusiastic about Clinton as they were about Obama, Trump’s   to white nationalist voters has resonated negatively among   voters; the “perceived importance” of voting for the president is higher this year than it was in 2012. In other words, black voters are still committed to casting their ballots this cycle. ”All of this might lead to an early electorate that is even more Democratic and more diverse than in the Obama elections  —   but all of this is contingent on all kinds of assumptions,” Gronke said. Early voting demographics have been changing There has been a shift in early voting demographics in the past two decades. ”Prior to 2008, these ‘decided’ early voters matched demographic patterns that are   in American politics,” Gronke said; they were older, educated, wealthier, ideological, and highly partisan. And for the most part, particularly with   voters, these early voters mostly leaned Republican, which can also be attributed to a strong GOP push for   absentee voting in the 1990s and 2000s. Meanwhile,   early voters tend to lean more toward Democrats.    Barack Obama’s presidential campaign made a big stride with Democratic   early voting in 2008, targeting areas with higher Democratic voter potential  —   areas that also had higher populations of   voters. Black churches used Sunday services to push people to the polls in what they called ”souls to the polls” initiatives, University of Wisconsin Madison political scientist Barry Burden recalls. In 2012, more restrictive early voting laws also served as a mobilization tool to get out the vote, Gronke notes. “It ended up being nearly impossible to extract out the impact of the laws from the impact of the campaign,” he said. For the most part, 2016 remains consistent with these trends. Notably, Democrats and the Clinton campaign have focused this year’s efforts on   voting. They have had tangible results in states like Florida, where voter registration between Democrats and Republicans has evened out. While “compared to   early voting, absentee voting patterns in Florida do not deviate as much from 2012,” as Burden notes, Republicans don’t lead Democrats with as wide a margin in absentee voting this year. And according to the Clinton campaign, more African Americans requested mail ballots in this election than ever before. Clinton may not have the same pull this year. But it’s still early to tell, and as University of Florida’s McDonald wrote for the Huffington Post Sunday, Democrats still have a lot of unreturned ballots in their hands: Second, there are 71, 700 more Democrats than Republicans who have requested mail ballots but have not returned them. While Democrats typically have a problem with unreturned mail ballots, my sense is given this lopsided number that at some point Democrats will start achieving at least daily parity in the returned mail ballots. There are limitations to reading the early voting tea leaves It’s important to remember  —   as a general scan of contradicting headlines on early voting from the New York Times to Fox News will show you  —   that it’s still early to say definitively that these early voting numbers indicate final results:    “It is quite difficult to discern what the election results will be from early voting numbers,” Burden said. “The patterns do not tell a coherent national story.   …     Ballots are coming in at different rates for the parties in each state. The messages appear to differ from one state to the next. ” And as McDonald warns in his weekly update on the early voting numbers for Huffington Post: “These are still early hints of the direction of the election. There is still much time left in the election, and these numbers can be affected by how election officials run the election, campaign strategies to mobilize voters, and voters’ behaviors. ” There are a lot of limitations: States reporting early voting totals don’t always include all counties; some states, like North Carolina, require party registration, while others, like Wisconsin, don’t; and numbers derived from party registrations are fallible. These distinctions can explain some of the early results. University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket crunched the numbers for FiveThirtyEight on how well early voting numbers predicted the final tally in past elections. He simply concluded, “The relationship is positive, but it’s pretty noisy. In other words, knowing how a party is doing in early voting doesn’t tell you much about how it will do once all the votes are counted. ” In fact, he found that looking at early voting numbers in 2012 would give you “wildly misleading” results: Democrats maintained substantial leads among early voters in North Carolina, Louisiana and West Virginia, and were trailing by a relatively narrow margin in Oklahoma, but still lost those states when all the votes were counted. Republicans won early voters in Pennsylvania and Colorado but lost the final tallies there. Maryland was a safely Democratic state in 2012, but the 75 percent of the early vote that went the Democrats’ way was a far cry from the 63 percent of the total vote they won once voting was finished. Even so, it seems like on a macro level, early voting supports national polling  —   which might be a sign of relief for Clinton voters. "
2016-11-08,"Washington  A Nevada court judge forcefully denied a request Tuesday from Donald Trump’s campaign to direct a county registrar of voters to preserve and segregate ballots from voting machines in four early voting sites in the Las Vegas area where Latino voters showed up in record numbers. The Trump campaign said Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria kept polling locations open two hours beyond their designated closing times. Clark County saw its record for   early vote turnout shattered Friday when 57, 174 people cast their ballots, according to data from the Nevada secretary of state’s office, as Hillary Clinton and Democrats sought to build up a prohibitive advantage over Trump before Tuesday in the key state.  Trump’s lawyers asked for an order to have the pertinent early vote ballots    those cast after the designated polling hours Friday    not to be ”  or interspersed” with other ballots.  Judge Gloria Sturman, of the District Court for Clark County Nevada, ruled from the bench, saying Gloria was already obligated by state law to maintain the records that the Trump campaign is seeking. ”I can’t obligate him to do something he is already obligated to do,” Sturman said, later adding, ”This is Election Day. He has other things to be doing.” Dan Kulin, a spokesperson for the county, told CNN that no early voting stations extended their closing times. They did, however, process voters who were in line at closing time to allow as many people to vote as possible.   Judge warns Trump campaign about internet trolls, Trump’s campaign also sought information about the people who were present at the sites in dispute    a request Sturman angrily shot down, expressing her frustration with Brian Hardy, a lawyer for the campaign.  ”Do you watch Twitter?” she asked. ”There are internet trolls who could get this information and harass people who just want to help their fellow citizens vote.” ”Why would I order them to make available to you information about people who work at polls when its not already a public requirement to do so. So that those people can be harassed for doing their civic duty?” She added: ”I’m just puzzled how you think you will use this evidence anyway.”  Donald F. McGahn II, Trump’s campaign attorney, said that the suit was filed to preserve records and that the county attorney made clear in open court that the records would be preserved. McGahn said that ensuring that records are persevered is standard business. Nevada key to both parties, Nevada’s six electoral votes may be critical Tuesday night, and the Senate race is key in terms of the balance of power.  Nevada’s Republican Party chairman, Michael McDonald, told a Trump audience in Reno on Saturday that polling locations were kept open late so that a ”certain group” could vote. ”Last night, in Clark County, they kept a poll open ’til 10 o’clock at night so a certain group could vote,” McDonald said in introductory remarks at a Trump rally. ”The polls are supposed to close at 7. This was kept open until 10. Yeah, you feel free right now? You think this is a free and easy election? That’s why it’s important.” At that rally, Trump suggested that the polling location’s extended closing time to allow voters to cast their ballots was a sign of a ”rigged system” pitted against his campaign. ”It’s being reported that certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring democratic voters in. Folks, it’s a rigged system. It’s a rigged system and we’re going to beat it. We’re going to beat it,” Trump said. ”From the polling, it appears that Nevada is so close that the Trump campaign thinks it’s worth challenging any violation in voting protocol,” said Robert Lang of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ”The numbers that came in could represent several thousand people across the four precincts, which could determine who wins the electoral college vote or change the Senate race.  Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyist and professor at the University of Texas Law School, questioned what Trump’s campaign got as a result of the suit. ”The real question is whether the Trump campaign truly wanted an order from the district court, or whether the point was simply to begin to make a record around which the result in Nevada might be challenged after the fact,” Vladeck said. ”If the former, it failed miserably. If the latter, it seems like a lot of wasted effort if, as the court ruled, state law already required all of this information to be preserved.” Hillary Clinton’s campaign praised the judge’s ruling. ”We’re pleased the judge swiftly denied what was a frivolous attempt to disenfranchise voters in Clark County and a desperate response to the record turnout we’re seeing in Nevada and across the country. Every voice needs to be heard in this election and both campaigns should be working to ensure that every American will have easy access to the ballot box,” said Clinton campaign spokesman Glen Caplin."
2016-11-09,"Here is what eight years of President Obama’s “ ” reign have wrought. The weekend before Election Day, Hillary Clinton grinned from ear to ear at a Cleveland rally while reciting a verse from  ’s remix of Young Jeezy’s “My President Is Black. ” As the rapper and his Black Lives Matter —  promoting wife, Beyoncé, beamed on stage nearby,   Clinton twanged with a stilted accent: Remember, Jay memorably said: “Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk, and Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run, and Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly. ” This would be comical if not for the noxious cynicism of it all. Clinton may not remember (if she was ever aware in the first place) but the original version of “My President Is Black” is a brazen middle finger to nonblack America. Just a few lines after the verse Hillary quoted, the song taunts: Hello Miss America, hey pretty ladyRed, white, and blue flag, wave for me babyNever thought I’d say this s*** baby I’m goodYou can keep your p**** I don’t want no more BushNo more war, no more IraqNo more white lies, the President is black, Could there have been a more perfect beclownment to cap Clinton’s   “Stronger Together” campaign? After denigrating millions of Trump supporters as “deplorable” and “irredeemable” earlier this year, Clinton then unctuously confessed on Election Eve: “I regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became. ” Note the classic textbook employment of the passive voice to evade personal responsibility. The good news is that after being blasted as haters by Clinton’s   minions, after being slapped down as racial “cowards” by Clintonite holdover Eric Holder, after being lambasted as “xenophobes” and “nativists” by immigration expansionists in both parties, after enduring a string of faked hate crimes blamed on conservatives, after ceaseless accusations of “Islamophobia” in the wake of jihad attacks on American soil, after baseless accusations of “homophobia” for protesting the government’s    coercion, and after mourning a growing list of police officers ambushed and targeted by violent thugs seeking racial vengeance, an undeniable movement of citizens in the 2016 election cycle decided to push back. When all is said and done, one of the most important cultural accomplishments of Donald Trump’s bid will be the platform he created for Americans of all colors, ethnicities, political affiliations, and socioeconomic backgrounds to defy   identity politics. Beltway   expediently focused on Trump’s white and conservative supporters, who are rightly sick and tired of   double standards. But they ignored the increasingly vocal constituency of     American people against political correctness who don’t fit old narratives and boxes. And the same “Never Trump” pundits and establishment political strategists who gabbed endlessly about the need for “minority outreach” after 2012 were flummoxed by the blacks, gays, Latinos, women, and Democrats who rallied behind the GOP candidate. The most important speech of the 2016 election cycle wasn’t delivered by one of the presidential candidates. It came from iconoclastic Silicon Valley   and Trump supporter Peter Thiel, who best explained the historically significant backlash against the intolerant tolerance mob and phony  . “Louder voices have sent a message that they do not intend to tolerate the views of one half of the country,” he observed at the National Press Club last week. He recounted how the gay magazine The Advocate, which had once praised him as a “gay innovator,” declared he was “not a gay man” anymore because of his libertarian,   politics. “The lie behind the buzzword of diversity could not be made more clear,” Thiel noted. “If you don’t conform, then you don’t count as diverse, no matter what your personal background. ” Trump’s eclectic coalition was bound by that common thread: disaffected individuals tired of being told they don’t count and discounted because their views do not properly “match” their gender, chromosomes, skin color, or ethnicity. That is exactly why the more they and their nominee were demonized, the stronger their support grew. “No matter what happens in this election,” Thiel concluded last week, “what Trump represents isn’t crazy and it’s not going away. ” He’s right. I too often take for granted my own personal awakening about the entrenched tribalism of identity politics at a crazy   college in the early 1990s. The liberation from collectivist ideology is profound and lasting. Witnessing so many outspoken newcomers arrive at this enlightenment, however circuitous the route, has been the most encouraging and underappreciated phenomenon of the 2016 campaign.,"

2016-11-13,"Mayor de Blasio plans on riding Donald Trump’s suprise presidential victory  —   all the way to the bank. De Blasio sent an email to supporters Sunday morning playing up New Yorkers’ fears of a Trump presidency and vowing to “stand up to any attempt to deport people in our city, take away health insurance from the poorest among us, or undermine the reproductive rights of women”  —   all while asking for a donation to his   campaign next year. “While [Trump] only received small pockets of support in New York City, much of it came from people who are prepared to spend a lot of money to defeat us next year,” De Blasio wrote in his email. “And if this election taught us anything, it’s that we must be prepared for everything. ” “So that’s why I need to ask,” he continued. “Make a $3 contribution to our   campaign as a way of saying you are more committed than ever to fight to protect the values we share. ” The email was sent from the mayor’s campaign account and includes a link to make contributions as high as $1, 000 directly to his 2017   campaign. Gov. Cuomo made a similar fundraising appeal to stand up for New Yorkers against Trump Saturday morning in an email to supporters, but disabled a link to the state Democratic Party’s campaign account hours later after Post inquiries. De Blasio has castigated Trump for months throughout the primary and general election for not sharing his values and called him a “racist. ” Trump has ridiculed the mayor as “one of the most incompetent men” and the “single worst mayor in the history of New York City,” in a July   with The Post. On the day after the election, Hizzoner pledged to find common ground and work with the   and the Trump administration to create jobs, protect residents and rebuild infrastructure despite “profound political disagreements. ” But he already promised to protect undocumented immigrants who could face deportation under a Trump presidency.

2016-11-14,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a key player in several   immigration measures and court cases, advised Trump on immigration during his campaign and will likely have a key role in shaping the new president’s policies. Kobach said Trump is likely to scrap the Obama administration’s approach of deporting only those who have been convicted, a policy he said releases dangerous people back into U. S. communities. “The most extreme criminals are deported while criminal arrestees not yet convicted are turned loose,” said Kobach. “[Under the new proposal,] criminal arrestees will be deported, there will be immediate improvement in safety for all Americans. ” Kobach stressed that Trump must sign off on decisions involving enforcement policies, but said candidate Trump signaled clearly what President Trump will do. “Ultimately it’s his call,” Kobach said. “There will be a great deal of consistency between the platform and   Trump’s policies  —   that is, with the caveat that every decision is the president’s decision. ” Kobach spoke to FoxNews. com a day after Trump appeared on CBS’s “60 Minutes” and said that dealing with immigration would be among his first priorities upon taking office in January. He said he would focus on getting criminals off the streets and out of the country, building a wall  —   though part of it might be a fence, he said  —   and that later he would turn his attention to what to do about other illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes. “After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about  —   who are terrific people,” Trump said. “They’re terrific people, but we are going make a determination at that. But before we make that determination . . . it’s very important, we are going to secure our border. ” Some 12 million people are believed to be living in the United States illegally. Roughly 40 percent entered on visas and did not leave when they expired. Kobach said that Trump will be able to boost enforcement of existing immigration laws right away by undoing Obama’s executive actions, and giving Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents more support and freedom to arrest, detain and deport people such as those with criminal records. “Obama ordered ICE agents to stop doing their jobs,” said Kobach, who represented ICE agents in a lawsuit challenging Obama’s executive actions. “The morale of ICE is the lowest morale of any federal agency. ” Kobach, who was a force behind Trump’s vow to build a wall along the U. S.  border, and have Mexico pay for it, said that Trump will have the mandate and supportive Congress, with Republicans having control next year of both chambers, to make immediate changes in the immigration system. “Americans think our laws need to be followed,” he said. “  Trump is in a unique position. He has the mandate from the American people to end illegal immigration and secure our borders for once and for all. ” Asked where the Trump administration might draw the line on criminals  —   whether a tougher approach would lead to the detention and deportation of only those arrested for felonies, or for lesser crimes, as well  —   Kobach declined comment. Kobach added that he did not want to get into details prematurely that had not yet been hammered out or that would put Trump on the spot. Kobach’s appointment to the transition team has raised speculation that he might be named to a post in the Trump administration, but he declined to comment on the prospect. Advocacy groups are girding for a pitched battle with the Trump administration over illegal immigration, and are warning that deportations   even of criminal suspects   will break up families. “This will rip apart families and become one of the darkest chapters in American history, all because he wants to throw red meat to his hard core white nationalist base,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a Washington D. C.  group. “His talk of ’criminals’ is a strategy to throw sand in the faces of the American people in hopes of covering his tracks. It’s up to all of us to make sure he doesn’t get away with it. ” Few people have been more influential in   and nationwide efforts to push for stricter immigration enforcement than the    Wisconsin native. Kobach, who holds degrees from Harvard, Yale and Oxford,   Arizona SB 1070   immigration law, which led to similar legislative efforts in several other states after Congress repeatedly failed to fix the system and address border security. Kobach served as chief adviser on immigration and border security in the U. S. Department of Justice, and helped shape enforcement programs after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, including the National Security   Registration System, which screened people seeking to enter the United States from countries where Al Qaeda was active. Kobach predicts that under Trump, local police and federal immigration agents will work more closely. “They play a vital role on being the eyes and ears of the federal government,” he said. “Most of the arrests by ICE in the past would come from local law enforcement. ”   "
2016-11-15,"It has been a week since Donald Trump won the majority of electoral college votes and became   of the US (and a week since he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton). It has been a week of endless questions and limited answers  —   how? why? And, perhaps most important of all: what now? More specifically, some have wondered whether Donald Trump would have been defeated if he had faced a different Democratic candidate: Bernie Sanders. On Wednesday, CNN journalist Wolf Blitzer asked Jane Sanders, wife of the former candidate for the Democratic nomination, if her husband would have had a better chance of beating Trump than Clinton. “Absolutely,” she replied, “but it doesn’t matter now. ” There’s mixed evidence for that certainty.  In the primaries, Sanders gained more votes than Clinton in Wisconsin and Michigan. Those are important states. Wisconsin, a formerly Democratic state, was narrowly won by Trump in the presidential election on Tuesday. In Michigan, the race was even closer, with Trump winning by just 11, 837 votes (which represents 0. 25% of all votes cast there). If Clinton had won just 109, 000 more votes in those states (plus Pennsylvania where she also narrowly lost) we would be calling her, and not Trump,  .  But that is a big “if” for a number of reasons. Perhaps Sanders would have won Wisconsin and Michigan but lost Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota and New Hampshire  —   states that were only narrowly won by the Democratic party in the presidential election. It’s true that Sanders won all of those states except Nevada in the primary season but there’s a much larger caveat here: voting behavior in the primaries is different to voting behavior in the presidential election.  If we can’t rely on primary vote counts to gauge Sanders chances, we’re not left with much else besides polling  —   a deeply flawed analytical tool. Nevertheless, it’s understandable why one of those polls is now being widely circulated. It found that in a race between Sanders and Trump, Sanders would have won with 56% of the vote. The national poll, which spoke to 1, 600 registered voters two days before the general election was conducted by Gravis Marketing. Even more than most polls, that one is deeply flawed because it asks individuals to consider an alternate reality where Sanders was a nominee. Considering completely hypothetical and   choices encourages some unrealistic answers in surveys  —   otherwise 27% of US adults would waterboard someone suspected of terrorism. Slightly better then is polling which regularly asks a far less hypothetical question: “Do you have a favorable opinion of candidate X? ”. The answers to that question are crucial in understanding why 2016 was no ordinary election year: Clinton and Trump were two of the most unpopular candidates US voters have ever been told to choose between. That dislike seemed to endure right up to the end of election season.  The story for Bernie Sanders though looks very different (the strength of that feeling might explain why, in Vermont, Sanders’ home state and one he has served as Senator since 2007, 18, 183 voters decided to write his name into their ballot as their presidential choice): More accurate perhaps is polling that asks about broader attitudes rather than people (if we had more such polling in the lead up to the election, perhaps the campaigns would have been more focused on policies).  One such attitude seems important in this election: trust in government is at a historic low according to research by Pew Research Center and 81% of likely voters said that federal government was corrupt according to a survey by Rasmussen Reports in February. (It should be noted that trust in mass media is at a historic low too).  Although Bernie Sanders has 34 years of political experience under his belt and Donald Trump has zero years, both candidates campaigned as outsiders and used   rhetoric regularly in their speeches. That’s potentially important for votes because more Americans identify as Independent today than at any time in the last few decades. In 2015, Gallup found 42% of US adults said they were independent, compared to 29% who said they were Democrat and 26% who said they were Republican.  There is one major drawback to all of these numbers though: they were collected before Donald Trump won a US presidential election  —   in the face of even the most trusted predictions. Everything is different now, and if Sanders were to test the numbers by competing against Trump in 2020, he will probably be doing so in a very different set of circumstances.  • This article was amended on 16 November 2016. An earlier version said Sanders had won several named states in the primary season except Colorado. He won those states except Nevada. In addition, the question put to Jane Sanders by Wolf Blitzer was clarified."
2016-11-16," Scientists have found evidence that tiny, distant Pluto harbors a hidden ocean beneath the frozen surface of its   central plain containing as much water as all of Earth’s seas. The finding, reported on Wednesday in two research papers published in the journal Nature, adds Pluto to a growing list of worlds in the solar system beyond Earth believed to have underground oceans, some of which potentially could be habitats for life. Pluto’s ocean, which is likely slushy with ice, lies 93 to 124 miles (150 to 200 km) beneath the dwarf planet’s icy surface and is about 62 miles (100 km) deep, planetary scientist Francis Nimmo of the University of California, Santa Cruz said in an interview. With its ocean covered by so much ice, Pluto is not a prime candidate for life, added Massachusetts Institute of Technology planetary scientist Richard Binzel, another of the researchers. But Binzel added that ”one is careful to never say the word impossible.” Liquid water is considered one of the essential ingredients for life. The discovery was made through an analysis of images and data collected by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, which flew past Pluto and its entourage of moons in July 2015. ”It shows that nature is more creative than we are able to imagine, which is why we go and explore,” Binzel said. ”We see what nature is capable of doing.” Despite being about 40 times farther from the sun than Earth, Pluto has enough radioactive heat left over from its formation 4. 6 billion years ago to keep water liquid. ”Pluto has enough rock that there’s quite a lot of heat being generated, and an ice shell a few hundred kilometers thick is quite a good insulator,” Nimmo said. ”So a deep subsurface ocean is not too surprising, especially if the ocean contains ammonia, which acts like an antifreeze.” Scientists made the discovery as they were trying to figure out why a   ( ) wide impact basin known as Sputnik Planitia, which contains the curious   region, was located in its present position near Pluto’s equator. Computer models showed the basin likely filled with ice, which caused Pluto to roll over, cracking its crust. That could happen only if Pluto possessed a subsurface ocean, the analysis found. New Horizons is on its way to another frozen world in the Kuiper Belt region of the solar system about 1 billion miles (1. 6 billion km) past Pluto. A flyby of the object, known as 2014 MU69, is scheduled on Jan. 1, 2019.

2016-11-17,"A California high school physical education teacher has been placed on paid administrative leave after she allegedly told a group of students, who refused to stand for the national anthem, that they would be deported under President Donald Trump. [According to NBC Bay Area, a group of students at Oak Grove High School, in South San Jose, decided to sit through the anthem during an event at the school, in an act of defiance against   Donald Trump last Wednesday.  San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who is seen as a role model for many youth, has also refused to stand for the national anthem. One of the female students in the group that decided not to stand reportedly said the teacher told them, “Good luck with being deported now that Donald Trump is president. You guys had it better here than you will over there. ” Superintendent Chris Funk learned of the incident after it was reported by the students, which prompted the district to place the unnamed teacher on administrative leave. “No question that some of our students who are undocumented are concerned about deportation and what’s going to happen to their families,” Funk said, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The Mercury News also notes that “[in] the aftermath of the election, the district has posted a letter on its homepage, saying that students deserve a secure environment to process the election results, and asking teachers to remain neutral, share information, listen to both sides of any issue and create a safe space in class and school for discussion. ” Breitbart Senior    Joel B. Pollak pointed out recently that some teachers in California, who had previously scared their students about Trump, are now struggling to calm students down about his election.

2016-11-18,"Yes, “The Weight of These Wings” is Miranda Lambert’s first album since divorcing her fellow country star Blake Shelton last year. And yes, it is filled with songs about romantic skepticism and ones about how the first steps you take after an old love breaks are tentative and fragile. And yes, it is a double album, the sort of gesture intended to connote seriousness of artistic and spiritual purpose, as well as suggesting that the font of feelings serving as inspiration is a roaring waterfall that cannot easily be contained. And yet it turns out that “Wings” isn’t so much about Ms. Lambert’s relationship to Mr. Shelton as it is about hers to the Nashville mainstream, which she has shunned, coveted, flirted with and rejected at various points in the last decade. “Wings” is her sixth album, and dating to before her 2005 debut, “Kerosene,” she’s been engaged in an elaborate dance with country music tradition and the current state of the genre. On the   competition “Nashville Star,” she was a striver then, on her first two major label albums, she was a dissenter, upending norms with verve and backbone. In the years since, she’s been, by turns, a traditionalist, a seemingly happy member of the Nashville establishment  —   especially in the years she and Mr. Shelton were winning female and male vocalist of the year at the Country Music Association Awards  —   and, at her most thrilling, a   boundary pusher being yanked (or, more accurately, yanking) in all sorts of wild directions. You could rarely accuse her of complacency, but maybe that’s the most perverse strategy on this album, which no one would have blinked at if it were an earthquake, but which is perhaps more cunning as a tremor. For the most part, these songs  —   vocals and all  —   were recorded live to tape, leaving a texture of rustle and warm air. (There are overdubs and rerecorded vocals here, but they do not dominate.) Ms. Lambert wants to communicate that, through all of her personal struggles, she is working, right down to the flubbed then rerecorded intro to the crunchy, almost rowdy “Bad Boy,” one of this album’s better songs, written with the underheralded   Mando Saenz. This approach is clearest  —   which is to say, the sound is the cloudiest  —   on this double album’s first, and better, half. “The Nerve” is unhurried, verging on indifferent, a perhaps inadvertent nod to when country first went   in the 1990s. “Pushin’ Time” is strikingly intimate, as if recorded from the middle of the round. And “Highway Vagabond” is downright shaggy, even though its lyrics about hippie drifters are better suited to Jake Owen. Produced by Frank Liddell, Glenn Worf and Eric Masse, this “Wings” is modestly scaled  —   something Ms. Lambert never has been, and isn’t always well suited to. Partly that’s because her piercing voice breaks in just the right places when her mood grows downcast, and explodes into colorful curlicues when she’s enthused, or peeved. That rarely happens here, though there is a vicious   “To Learn Her” (written with Ashley Monroe and Waylon Payne) which singes with Gary   acid. And Ms. Lambert takes a quick, zany turn on the album’s first half with the    songs “We Should Be Friends” and “Pink Sunglasses,” lightly comic feminism for the parts of the country where the local    is a Walmart: “If you’re lookin’ for love but willin’ to   men and mamas and Miller   then, we should be friends. ” Mostly, though, fragility reigns. “Tin Man” is a weepy warning: “Better thank your lucky   you ever felt one breakin’ ’d never want a heart. ” And “ ” is a plea, to a new lover, or to a listener expecting fireworks and instead getting a small campfire: “Like a caged bird barely set   me, I’m finding my wings. ” When this album whispers, as it does on large swaths of the second half, it neuters Ms. Lambert’s gifts. Even with a voice as signature as hers, there’s little to elevate songs like “Good Ol’ Days” or “Dear Old Sun. ” Most jarringly, this album doesn’t serve as a retort to its surroundings, and retort is what Ms. Lambert does best, especially because, in her hands, it can take on myriad thrilling shapes. But doing so draws attention, and what’s clear from this album is that Ms. Lambert is in retreat. Maybe the loudest person in the room could do with a little quiet."
2016-11-19,"TEL AVIV  —   Eleven Arab nations warned outgoing UN   Ban   that “expansionist” and “sponsor of terrorism” Iran has only intensified its policy of “aggression in the region and the continuation of support for terrorist groups” since the nuclear deal.   [“It is with a deep sense of frustration that we note that the Islamic Republic of Iran, with its expansionist regional policies, flagrant violations of the principle of sovereignty and constant interference in the internal affairs of Arab States, continues to play a negative role in causing tension and instability in our region,” a letter to Ban  —   signed by the UN envoys of Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates and Yemen  —   said.  The Arab ambassadors further expressed “concerted alarm” at “the export of its revolution to other countries. ” “We stress that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism in our region, from Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, to Houthis in Yemen and terrorist groups and cells in the Kingdom of Bahrain, Iraq, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and elsewhere,” the letter stated. “Unfortunately, since the signing of the nuclear deal, we have seen nothing but increased Iranian aggression in the region and the continuation of support for terrorist groups,” the letter said. “We remain firm in our resolve that any interference by the Islamic Republic of Iran in the domestic affairs of Arab states is unacceptable and must be confronted,” the letter stated. “[T]he only way forward is for the Islamic Republic of Iran to comprehensively change its foreign policies and end hostilities, thus paving the way for the region to enter a new era of stability and development. ” UN Watch, a   monitoring NGO, praised the letter as “important. ” “Iran likes to dismiss all criticism of its human rights violations and brutality at home and abroad as part of a Western plot, but that’s hard to sustain when the accusers are all Muslim governments, including recent allies of Iran like Sudan,” UN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer said in a statement. For its part, Iran responded to the Arab nations’ claims, calling them “unfounded,” Iran’s   Press TV reported. “It is ridiculous that those regimes who themselves are the nurturers and exporters of extremism and Takfiri dogma to Iraq, Syria and other countries are now accusing Iran of supporting terrorism,” Iranian ambassador to the UN   Khoshroo wrote in a letter to UN chief Ban. Saudi Arabia has condemned Iran’s military support of Lebanese terror group Hezbollah which has joined the Assad regime in Syria. The Kingdom launched a coalition to support Yemen in its fight against the   Houthi rebels who have taken control of the country’s capital. In his UN General Assembly speech in September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that many states in the region are recognizing that Israel is not their enemy. Rather, he said, they realize “that Israel is their ally. Our common enemies are ISIS and Iran. Our common goals are security, prosperity and peace. I believe that in the years ahead we will work together to achieve these goals. ”"
2016-11-20,"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while discussing the controversy over a supposed registry of Muslim immigrants,   Donlad Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said, “We’re not going to have a registry based on a religion. ”  When asked if he could, “equivocally rule out a registry for Muslims?” Priebus replied, “Look, I’m not going to rule out anything. I wouldn’t  —   we’re not going to have a registry based on a religion. What I think what we’re trying to do is say there are some people  —   certainly not all people, Chuck  —   here are some people that are radicalized. And there are some people that have to be prevented from coming into this country. ” “President Trump’s position is consistent with bills in the House and Senate that say the following: If you come  —   if you want to come from a place or an area around the world that harbors and trains terrorists, we have to suspend that operation until a better vetting system is put in place,” he continued. “When that happens, when the better vetting system is put in place, then the radical folks  —   they will not be allowed in, but then others will be allowed in. But only until that is done. That’s what General Michael Flynn believes. That’s what President Trump believes. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
2016-11-21,"Kanye West likened himself to Donald J. Trump at a concert on Saturday in California before tumbling into a     speech addressing radio programmers, MTV, his friends and collaborators Jay Z and Beyoncé, Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg and more. After getting an array of grievances off his chest  —   from   politics to   politics  —   Mr. West ended the performance with a microphone drop, having played only three songs, leaving fans bitter and upset, according to reactions on social media. “It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world,” Mr. West said from his floating platform stage above the crowd. “Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in Middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. ” The brief concert, at the Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, came two nights after Mr. West shocked his audience by announcing at a show in San Jose, Calif. that he had not voted, but would have cast a ballot for Mr. Trump if he had. Though the rapper affirmed his belief in the importance of issues like Black Lives Matter and women’s rights, he praised Mr. Trump’s “method of communication” as “very futuristic. ” On Saturday night, in a trademark polemic the likes of which had been mostly absent from his current Saint Pablo tour, Mr. West doubled down on his embrace of   political incorrectness and opined on the state of the media. “Yeah, I’m taking his lead,” Mr. West said of the  . “A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost,” the rapper began. “You know why? Because y’all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. ” Turning his focus on the music industry, Mr. West questioned gatekeepers for promoting songs by Drake but not Frank Ocean, and wondered once again why he is often overlooked at awards shows. Referring to this year’s MTV Video Music Awards, Mr. West pulled back the curtain on what he said was the political    dealings that go into booking celebrities for such events. “Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over ‘Hotline Bling,’” he said. “Sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win,” he continued. “I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life  —   even at the risk of my own success, my own career. ” However, Mr. West said, such   was necessary for real progress. “Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was,” he said. “Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this”  —   the rapper screamed  —   “and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change” things. When more music failed to follow the impromptu stump speech, disappointed fans turned to social media to demand refunds. On Sunday, the Golden 1 Center announced that ticketholders would be paid back in full, including Ticketmaster fees. On Monday, a representative for Mr. West said that remaining dates on the second leg of the “Saint Pablo” tour have been canceled. Even amid his raw, spontaneous and sometimes rambling monologue, Mr. West seemed to know he was courting controversy. “I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way,” he said. “But I’m going to say how I feel. ” He added, “Get ready to have a field day, press. Get ready, get ready. Because the show’s over. ”"
2016-11-22,"  Donald Trump has disavowed the white nationalist movement which dubs itself the “ ” and which rallied around his candidacy, but vigorously defended his former campaign chairman and newly appointed White House chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, a man accused of fanning the flames of white supremacy. “I don’t want to energize the group, and I disavow the group,” Trump said at a meeting with a group of New York Times journalists, in response to a question from the newspaper’s executive editor, Dean Baquet. “And if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why,” Trump said.  The selection of Bannon, the executive chairman of the   website Breitbart News  deepened the fears of liberal activists that the Trump administration would embolden and enable antisemites, racists and misogynists of the   “  ”. “I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist or   or any of the things, the terms we could use, I wouldn’t even think about hiring him,” said Trump on Tuesday, according to journalists in attendance. “Breitbart is just a publication. They cover stories like you cover stories. They are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than the New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that has become quite successful. It’s got readers, and it does cover subjects on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. It’s a pretty big thing,” said Trump, according to a tweet from Times political reporter Michael Grynbaum. New York Times journalists also quizzed Trump on his commitment to free speech, the first amendment of the constitution. “I think you’ll be happy,” he replied. The meeting, billed as a lunchtime discussion between New York Times journalists and five members of the Trump campaign including the   was contentious from its inception.  Hours before the meeting was scheduled to start, the   abruptly canceled it, claiming on Twitter that the newspaper, which he called “failing” and “not nice” had changed the “terms and conditions” of the meeting. The newspaper confirmed the meeting was back on just hours later. The    meeting was attended by 23 reporters, editors and columnists and four members of Trump’s campaign team. It covered topics ranging from what Trump perceives as the media’s “unfair” treatment of him, to the roles his children and business will play in his administration, to Syria and climate change. Trump, who tweeted in 2012 that global warming was a hoax “created by and for the Chinese” in order to harm US business, acknowledged on Tuesday that climate change had “some” connection to human activity. “I think there is some connectivity. Some, something. It depends on how much,” he said, according to tweets from reporters. He also added he was concerned about climate change mitigation and “how much it will cost our companies”. When asked if Trump plans to withdraw from international climate deals, such as the Paris accord, he replied: “I’m looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it. ” Trump also altered his stance on his former rival Hillary Clinton. Despite having regularly referred to Clinton as a criminal who deserved jail time during his campaign, a notion echoed by supporters’ chants of “lock her up” during his rallies, Trump confirmed he does not intend to jail Clinton for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. “My inclination would be for whatever power I have on the matter is to say let’s go forward. This has been looked at for so long, ad nauseum,” said the  . Locking up Clinton “would be very, very divisive for the country” said Trump, according to reporters in attendance. Trump was also quizzed by editors and reporters about his own conflicts of interest with his family’s business, a large real estate company. “The law’s totally on my side, the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” said Trump, according to political reporter Maggie Haberman. “In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. There’s never been a case like this,” said Trump, noting that he is delegating the    running to his children in order to focus on the presidency."
2016-11-23,"Mosul’s residents are fleeing in growing numbers as Iraqi forces push deeper into the country’s second largest city, and the   extremists are fighting for every block, exploiting the dense urban terrain and using civilians as human shields. On Wednesday the tide of displaced people reached the Samah district, where Iraqi medics treated dozens of wounded, including at least six soldiers. At one point, four children and a man from the same family were rushed into the station, bleeding heavily as their relatives wailed in grief. A mortar round had slammed into the inner courtyard of their home. A few minutes after being brought to the aid station, a    girl with a head wound was pronounced dead. Then the main rush came  —   hundreds of civilians racing forward on a dirt road. The troops ordered them to halt, saying they had intelligence that ISIS might send suicide bombers disguised as civilians. One of the men raised his shirt to show that he wasn’t armed, saying he was desperate for food. Mosul, which fell to ISIS in the summer of 2014, is still home to more than 1 million people. Fearing a mass exodus, authorities have urged residents to stay inside their homes. But the presence of civilians has prevented the U. S.  Iraqi forces from using overwhelming force, slowing their advance and prolonging the city’s agony. The U. N. says at least 68, 000 people have fled the fighting in Mosul, including 8, 300 over the past four days. Later on Wednesday, Iraqi soldiers arrived from the front lines with a man who was bound and hooded. They said they had caught him burning tires to help the militants hide from airstrikes and the drones that buzzed overhead. Trembling, the man said he had been forced to aid the extremists. Black Humvees carried wounded soldiers back from the front. The body of a special forces soldier killed in combat was wrapped in a blanket on the hood of a vehicle. The Iraqi military does not release official casualty figures, but field medics say dozens of troops have been killed and wounded since the Mosul operation began last month. Mortar rounds, artillery and gunfire rang out throughout the day, punctuated by occasional booms from airstrikes that sent plumes of smoke into the air. A   airstrike by the U. S.  coalition struck a bridge across the Tigris River, which divides the city in two, leaving only one crossing intact and disrupting ISIS supply lines. It was the second bridge to be struck this week, and two other bridges were destroyed by airstrikes last month. Until now, most of the fighting has been on the eastern bank of the Tigris. Iraqi forces are expected to use pontoon bridges when they reach the river. A spokesman for one of several   Shiite militias meanwhile said they had seized a road to the northwest of Mosul linking the city to Raqqa, the de facto capital of the ISIS   caliphate. The militias have been converging on Tal Afar, an   town west of Mosul that had a Shiite majority before falling to the extremists in 2014. ”We have cut off Tal Afar from Mosul and we cut off Mosul from Syria,” Jaafar   a spokesman for the Hezbollah Brigades, told The Associated Press. Elsewhere in Iraq, more than a dozen   attacks in and around Baghdad killed at least 31 people and wounded 103, according to police and health officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. ISIS still regularly targets the capital despite suffering a series of battlefield losses elsewhere in the country over the past year."
2016-11-24,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” Rep. Elijah Cummings ( ) said that he doesn’t “necessarily” think the Democratic Party should move away from identity politics, but that the party should “concentrate” on economic issues.  Cummings responded to a question on Senator Bernie Sanders’ statement that the Democratic Party should move away from identity politics by stating, “I think we need to  —   no, I don’t necessarily agree. I think we need to deal with economics. I think economics is very important, but I think that we need to still pay attention to so many people who have been left out of the system in one way or another. Just like what I just talked about with voting rights of certain segments of our population. I think we can do both. But we’ve got to concentrate on economics, because a lot of people are suffering, and   and Hispanics are suffering probably more than other parts of our communities. ” (  RCP) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
2016-11-25,"The alleged shooter in the murder of nine at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church has been found competent to stand trial. [Dylann Storm Roof, 22, could be sentenced to death if convicted of the murders committed in June 2015, according to the Associated Press.  Breitbart News reported on June 20, 2015 that a manifesto was found that was believed to be Roof’s. The manifesto, which was registered in the alleged killer’s name, was reported to have revealed “deeply racist,     and white supremacist views. ” It was created in February of the same year as the murders. The   defendant reportedly said in his manifesto with regard to his experience with blacks —  “Ni —    are stupid and violent. ” He added “Jewish agitation of the black race” is the reason blacks behave as they do. His solution —  “Segregation was not a bad thing   …     It existed to protect us from them. ” He also expressed the opinion that apartheid as in South Africa should be imposed to strip blacks of their rights. Roof was equally racist as to his beliefs about Jews: “I think that if we could somehow destroy the Jewish identity, then they wouldn’t cause much of a problem. ” “If we could somehow turn every Jew blue for 24 hours, I think there would be a mass awakening” against the Jewish people, “because people would be able to see plainly what is going on. ” “Hispanics are obviously a huge problem for America,” but while he said he admired “White Hispanics,” “they are still our enemies,” he expressed. Roof also said, “I hate the sight of the American flag. Modern American patriotism is an absolute joke. ” Roof concluded that he had “no choice” but to act. “We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. ” Federal District Judge Richard Gergel made the ruling on Friday morning, according to USA Today. The judge made the competency decision after two days of hearings. Roof was present for the   discussions. Various media outlets objected to the lack of public accessibility. Prosecutors in the case are seeking the death penalty and jury selection begins Monday. Roof faces 33 charges for the mass murder of the worshipers at the church.

I think people are so fed up with Washington, this election was a mandate with change and the most catastrophic thing Republicans could do is go back to business as usual.” Cruz was responding to a question about some Trump’s flips on campaign promises, just weeks after winning the election, including saying he would not pursue a prosecution of Hillary Clinton and that he would like to keep pieces of Obamacare.  Republican leaders in Congress have promised to help Trump push through top priorities, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has cautioned against Republicans going too far, lest they face a backlash at the ballot box. Democrats, who similarly swept into power in 2008, were sharply rebuked by voters in 2010. Cruz, who was an ardent opponent of Trump until the final months of the campaign, was asked about his charges that Trump was a ”pathological liar” and ”utterly amoral.”  ”You know, I’m not going to relitigate the past. I’m going to focus on the future. I’m going to focus on what’s in front of us and on fixing the problems we have,” Cruz said, declining to either reiterate or retract his previous comments."
2016-11-28," In one of the better stories written about Donald Trump’s core base of supporters during the 2016 campaign, the Atlantic’s Salena Zito observed that while the national media had a tendency to take Trump literally without taking his presidential ambitions seriously, his fans did just the reverse: They took him seriously but not literally.     As a point about the state of mind of Trump supporters, Zito is absolutely correct. But one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, the   billionaire Peter Thiel, took Zito’s turn of phrase and inverted its meaning. He said that the media misunderstands Donald Trump by taking him literally rather than seriously.  What we’ve seen thus far of Trump’s transition, however, shows just the opposite. The national press’s Trump coverage did to an extent err by not taking him seriously enough. But it also failed in exactly the same way many Trump supporters failed. The celebrity candidate seemed so much more emotionally invested in his rallies than his policy proposals that not nearly enough attention was paid to the literal commitments he was making and what they literally said.  But throughout history and across various countries, the best guide to how politicians will govern is to pay attention to their policy promises. And Trump’s transition so far suggests that this is an area where he will be typical. Like any president, he won’t accomplish 100 percent of what he promised to do. But he’ll make a good faith effort at the vast majority of it, and probably succeed in many cases.     We should, in other words, have taken Trump both seriously and literally.     Jeff Sessions shows Trump is really serious about immigration I’m from New York, so the Trump supporters who I know are disproportionately New Yorkers. They’re the kind of politically moderate whites who voted for Rudy Giuliani and George Pataki in the 1990s, but also for Bill Clinton and Chuck Schumer. Some of them work in real estate. And like real estate guys everywhere, they think a broad crackdown on Latin American immigration would be a terrible idea  —   simultaneously crunching their workforce and reducing demand for their product. Since Trump himself was a New York real estate guy, they simply assume that he agrees with them about this as just bubba bait  —   exactly the same as how Trump obviously isn’t a sincere social conservative on questions of sexual morality.  And yet Trump’s very first Cabinet appointment was Jeff Sessions as attorney general.     Sessions is most infamous with the liberal public for his past history of racist statements and his broad brush opposition to civil rights causes. But in the halls of Congress, Sessions is known as a very serious,   and committed opponent of immigration to the United States. He led the charge against George W. Bush’s attempt at immigration reform in 2007 and again against the   effort in 2013. And importantly, Sessions isn’t just opposed to some hazy notion of “amnesty”  —   he’s a full spectrum immigration hawk, who opposes both legal and illegal immigration of both   and   workers.  Trump’s first 100 days agenda features a   promise to look into “visa abuse” and the   landing team at the Department of Justice includes Ronald Tenpas, who has expertise in eminent domain lawsuits pertaining to the seizure of land for the purposes of building border security barriers.  Trump’s immigration policy, in other words, is shaping up to be exactly the immigration policy he ran on. One that was written for him largely by former Sessions staffers and their allies in the immigration enforcement unions. None of this necessarily means that Trump will succeed in constructing a   concrete wall across the entire border  —   the congressional and logistical roadblocks are considerable  —   but he’s prepping to take a real shot at doing what he can.     Trump has a very Trumpy White House team Gen. Michael Flynn was a very   intelligence officer until his success in the field earned him a job in Washington as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. At the DIA, he clashed with his peers in the leadership of the Intelligence Community and failed to convince the   he was right. He alienated the top brass in the uniformed military and developed a bad reputation for abusive behavior toward his subordinates. He got fired, and after that, seems to have gotten a little loopy  —   becoming an extremely trenchant Obama critic and occasional paid agent of the Russian government who developed views way outside the consensus zone of either Obama or his main Republican Party critics.  In short, he seems like a terrible choice to serve as national security adviser, a job whose main role is to coordinate the interagency process and that absolutely requires you to be able to not make everyone you work with hate you.  But Flynn’s foreign policy views  —   soft on Russia, extraordinarily harsh on Islam, hawkish without being neoconservative  —   are exactly the ones Trump articulated on the campaign trail. What’s more, Trump did not hide the fact that he held Flynn in high esteem; he relied on him constantly for counsel and promoted him as a major spokesperson.  So of course he’ll be joining Trump in the White House. As will Steve Bannon, a media impresario who’s spent years mainstreaming white nationalism and who has a poor relationship with elected leaders of the Republican Party. Bannon was the CEO of Trump’s campaign, which also mainstreamed white nationalism and had a poor relationship with elected leaders of the Republican Party, so there’s no reason for anything to change.  On economics and conflicts of interest Trump is doing what he said On the level of symbolism and atmospherics, Trump campaigned as a Rust Belt populist who was sharply critical of the global banking elite. He went so over the top in his painting of lurid conspiracy theories about bankers that the main question we discussed in the media was about Trump’s trafficking in   stereotypes.  Tuesday afternoon, however, Treasury Department sources told me that they’d finally heard from Trump’s transition, and their point man on financial regulation was going to be Alex Pollack of the American Enterprise Institute. AEI is a very   mainstream conservative think tank, and Pollack is neither an   nor a dedicated foe of the global banking elite. His view is that the Obama Treasury Department has been regulating gigantic “systemically significant” financial institutions too harshly, and that the regulatory apparatus that supervises them should be dismantled.     This will probably disappoint many of Trump’s supporters who took his antics seriously. But anyone who read his policy statements and took them literally would know that Trump has always been proposing a bonanza of tax cuts and deregulation for bankers.  Taking Trump literally would also have helped prepare voters for the unprecedented pile of corruption and conflicts of interest that are currently surrounding Trump’s business interests. Trump was only rarely asked about this on the campaign trail, but his campaign always said that Trump would continue to own a sprawling network of opaque privately held companies and that he would turn their    management over to his children. That is and always was a setup for an appalling level of corruption, but it’s exactly what he said he would do.  Taking Trump seriously but not literally meant assuming that, faced with the massive burdens of the presidency, Trump would, naturally, come up with a more serious solution. But that turns out to have been wishful thinking. You should always take politicians literally  The view that you should take politicians’ formal campaign promises very seriously is something that very few voters or journalists believe. But it’s validated by extensive research.  And it’s particularly true of presidents, because United States government is enormous. There are more than 4, 000 political appointees in the executive branch and many career public servants doing important policy work. The president cannot oversee an operation of that size based on private conversations about what he “really” wants any more than he can privately convey his “real” opinion to the thousands of congressional staffers whose work also crucially impacts his legacy. The literal text of a president’s positions is not the only means through which the president’s ideas are conveyed to the executive branch, but it is the simplest, broadest, and most effective means of doing so. The literal stated agenda is also a powerful tool in any kind of interagency dialogue or collaborative meeting. Anyone can say they have divined the true intentions of the Oval Office dictating what the policy “really” is, but only a handful of people would be remotely credible in trying to pull it off.    Pointing to the alignment of your proposed course of action with a literal policy statement, by contrast, is a pretty good argument: “We’re doing this because it’s what we said we were going to do” helps bring career staffers along, and it’s a good explanation to give to curious reporters. Life is inherently unpredictable. And Trump is more unpredictable than your average politician. But the best information about how he will govern is still the literal text of his formal proposals. It’s true that this is a bad way to understand what his supporters like about him, but it’s the best way to understand what he will do.   Watch: It’s on America’s institutions to check Trump     "
2016-11-29,"After running a divisive campaign, Trump promised  —   after winning  —   to be a president for all Americans, said representatives of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Council of La Raza and the American Federation of Teachers. Trump needs to follow through on that pledge and publicly denounce the   and   incidents that popped up around the country, said Richard Cohen, SPLC’s president. ”One of our great, great hopes at the Southern Poverty Law Center is that Mr. Trump mightily disappoints the white supremacists, the white nationalists who are celebrating his victory now,” Cohen said. In an interview on ”60 Minutes,” Trump  —   when told about some of the harassment  —   said if it was his supporters for them to ”stop it.” In an interview with The New York Times, Trump denounced the white supremacist movement when asked. But he needs to do more, the groups said. ”A   has to create a climate that keeps all Americans safe,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. In the 10 days following the November election, SPLC said it collected 867   incidents on its website and through the media from almost every state, with Hawaii, Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota the only exceptions. Their numbers exclude reports of online harassment. The group has not independently verified each claim but said it has weeded out any reported hoaxes.   hate incidents targeting Latinos, Asians and Africans made up the largest number of claims, even though many Latinos and Asians in the U. S. are   or   American citizens. Those incidents were followed by   and   incidents. Schools and universities were the most common places for incidents to happen. Most often the incidents were through graffiti and verbal harassment, according to SPLC’s information. For example, SPLC said a Colorado mother reported that her      daughter was approached by a boy who said, ”Now Trump is president, I’m going to shoot you and all the blacks I can find.” A Washington state teacher reported that ”Build a wall” was chanted in their lunchroom the day after the election. A Louisiana woman said she was getting ready to cross the street when a truck with three white men pulled up and shouted vulgar words at her. ”One began to chant ’Trump’ as they drove away,” the black woman said. And a lesbian couple in Austin, Texas, reported that ”DYKE,” ’’Trump” and a swastika were painted on their door. In a separate survey, more than 10, 000 teachers told SPLC they knew of more than 2, 500 fights, threats and other incidents related to election rhetoric, and reported an increase in slurs and derogatory language, swastikas, Confederate flags and Nazi salutes. ”This polarized and divisive election has left its mark on all of us, but most tragically on our children,” said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza. ”We have heard countless stories of harassment, intimidation and bullying of Latino and other students in schools around this country. This cannot stand.” The number of incidents has slowed in the days following the election but anyone expecting the hate to just vanish is being naive, Cohen said. ”It’s not just going to go away,” he said. In fact, the groups expect more   incidents around Inauguration Day, said Brenda Abdelall, charities program director of Muslim Advocates. ”To bring us together as a nation, (Trump) will need to disavow dangerous proposals and ideas that single out and demonize Muslims and other communities,” she said. Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said it is clear that not all Trump supporters are racist. But Trump ”needs to lead by example in both words and in deed,” Henderson said. ”The nation  —   and the world  —   are watching.”   "
2016-11-30,"Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) upon being asked about critics who have called him Russian President Vladimir Putin’s favorite Republican, told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Wednesday, “Putin is not a perfect guy at all, but he is not Joseph Stalin or even Nikita Khrushchev. ” Rohrabacher made the point that communism, not Russia specifically, was seen as the greatest threat during the Reagan years, and it was, by and large, defeated. [As for talk of his being on the list to become   Trump’s secretary of state, Rohrabacher said he would be content to remain in Congress however, he believes Trump needs a secretary of state whose thinking aligns with his own, and Rohrabacher is not convinced the names being bandied about fit that bill.  “What I believe is that I’m excited about what Donald Trump stands for,” he said, “and how he’s going to take American policy and make it   …     aimed at not some globalist theory of making the whole world better, but, instead, based on something that’s going to be good for the security of the people of the United States and what’s going to be good for the prosperity of the United States. ” Rohrabacher added that it was “an exciting thing that finally, we’ve got somebody on our side” in the White House, in contrast to Barack Obama. “How else do I qualify?” said Rohrabacher of the secretary of state position. “I’ll just have to say that I believe in those things strongly, so I think that’s why I’ve been trying to suggest I’d be very willing to take that job. ” He went on to detail his foreign policy experience dating back to even before his lengthy tenure in the Reagan White House up to the present day. Rohrabacher defined radical Islam as perhaps the greatest global threat to America today and said America should not simply dismiss joining with Russia in fighting it when our interests intersect. “Radical Islam is our threat today,” said Rohrabacher. “We have to prioritize, and a   Russia has the same incentive for us to work together because it threatens Russia, and they’re killing Russians. Radical Islamists are killing Russians like they’re killing western Europeans and Americans. For me to suggest that we work with Russia to defeat this threat, I think it is rational. ” He said he’s “taken a lot of heat” for his stance regarding Russia, but he does not believe it’s “in the interests of the American people who are interested in peace to keep vilifying Russia as if it’s still the Soviet Union that threatens us. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

2016-12-01,"Donald Trump announced in a series of tweets Wednesday that he will be taking himself ”completely out” of his business operations to avoid potential conflicts of interest as president. The   did not offer details of the plan or say that he would divest financially from his businesses, but he did promise a news conference in the coming weeks that would address the issue. New York Times investigative reporter Eric Lipton tells Fresh Air’s Terry Gross that because of a ”quirk in the law,” American presidents are not mandated to separate themselves from their businesses. ”He could legally continue to operate them and even take actions as president that would benefit those businesses, and it wouldn’t be a formal ethics violation,” Lipton says. Lipton has been investigating Trump’s business holdings in the U. S. and around the world. Referring to Trump’s potential conflicts, Lipton says, ”They’re everywhere.” He notes that the   already mixed his business interests with his job governing when he praised his own business partner during a telephone call with the president of Turkey. It was ”a very odd circumstance,” Lipton says of Trump’s phone call. ”We want a president to be simply thinking about what are the interests of the United States and having zero consideration for his or her financial interests in any conversations with leaders there.” On the problems inherent in Trump’s idea of turning his business over to his children, He appointed them to his transition committee. His daughter and his sons were present for a meeting or greeting with the prime minister of Japan. His daughter Ivanka has participated in telephone conversations that the president [elect] had with the president of Argentina and with the president of Turkey, and there may be many others we just don’t know about. So he’s already been mixing the roles of dad and   and CEO in a way that would compromise any suggestion that it would not present a conflict for his children to be running those businesses. On Ivanka Trump’s role in the Trump Organization, When I look at the Trump Organization globally, when I go onto the websites that are selling the apartment units in Pune, India, or the websites in Mumbai or just about anywhere, you see photographs of Ivanka Trump. She is like their  . She’s a sign of American affluence and beauty, and her image has become as important as the image of Donald Trump himself. . .. Her simple presence as part of the entourage of the Trump administration is helping that brand promote itself. . .. It’s just this blurring of lines which we’ve never seen before with the White House. On a conflict of interest the   is facing just blocks from the White House, The Post Office building, a few blocks from the White House, that the Trump Organization is leasing to operate the new Trump International Hotel . .. is owned by the General Services Administration  —   essentially the federal government  —   and it’s leased to the Trump family, and the president is going to appoint the head of the GSA, and at the same time as this family is leasing the building from the GSA. . .. There’s a provision in the contract that the Trump Organization signed that no federal employee should benefit from this lease. So how can he simultaneously be the tenant and the landlord in this contract, essentially, because he appoints the guy who oversees the agency? On Trump appointing the head of the National Labor Relations Board that will oversee a dispute at one of Trump’s hotels, [At the] Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas there’s a dispute going on right now with the culinary union. The employees at that hotel voted to organize, and the Trump Organization and its partner in Las Vegas refused to recognize that as a legal union formation. Then there was an appeal filed at the National Labor Relations Board, accusing them of unfair labor practices. And in two occasions recently the National Labor Relations Board has ruled against the Trump hotel saying essentially it’s violating federal labor laws. But the president is going to appoint the members of the National Labor Relations Board. I mean, how’s that going to be? How is the National Labor Relations Board simultaneously going to be hearing labor appeals against the Trump Organization  —   even if his kids are running it  —   and have its members appointed by the president? On Democrats in Congress requesting investigations into Trump’s conflicts of interest, I don’t see why the Republicans have any interest in empowering a committee, giving it subpoena power, giving it staff, to investigate potential conflicts by the president. The notion that the Republicans would create their equivalent of a Benghazi committee to investigate their president at the same time as they want to try to move an ambitious political agenda to remake the environmental and financial laws of the United States, I don’t see that happening politically. There will be pressure on them that will be put by Democrats, there will be lots of letters written by Democrats asking them to do this, but I don’t see why they would do it, honestly."
2016-12-02,"  Four weeks after the election, tensions between top operatives at the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton campaigns erupted during a Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics discussion that was intended to record history by drawing out the internal deliberations of both campaigns. Facing off at long tables on opposite sides of the room during a   panel, raw emotions on both sides exploded as operatives debated how Trump had won the divisive campaign. There were periods of calm, substantive discussion about data, metrics and target states, but many moments where tempers flared, with acrimony mirroring the 2016 race. Advisers on the opposing sides shouted over each other. Accusations of lying flew between them. There was lots of   on both sides. Operatives snapped at one another for interrupting, as an air of mutual contempt settled within the room. Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway called members of Clinton’s team ”bitter.” ”Hey guys, we won,” Conway said at one point, challenging Clinton’s team to ”accept the results of the election.” ”He was the better candidate. That’s why we won.” But the Clinton team did not back down. Chief Strategist Joel Benenson charged that the Trump campaign was successful, in part, by sending a series of ”dog whistles” and messages with racial overtones that appealed to white voters who believed the government favored minorities. Benenson pressed the Trump team to explain exactly who their supporters want ”to take America back from.” He disputed the Trump team’s argument that his economic message led him to victory. Clinton won a majority of voters who were concerned about the economy, he said, while Trump won more voters who believe minorities are favored in this country. Clinton Senior Adviser Karen Finney added that Trump had tapped into ”underlying cultural anxiety about change that we were not willing to do.” In a key moment that flipped the initial tone from fairly civil to acrimonious, Clinton advisers Jennifer Palmeiri and Finney charged the Trump campaign with providing a platform for white supremacist views by hiring Breitbart Chief Executive Steve Bannon. The Trump team had elevated the     movement into the mainstream, they said, with Palmieri adding that Clinton’s speech denouncing the extremist movement was the proudest moment of the campaign.    ”Are you going look me in the face and say I provided a platform for white supremacists?” Kellyanne Conway asked incredulously. Both Palmieri and Finney nodded and said ”yes.” ”I would rather lose than win the way you did,” Palmieri said. ”You guys are pathetic,” Trump adviser David Bossie replied, accusing them of a smear campaign against Bannon.  Bossie argued that Clinton lost not because of headwinds, but because of distrust due to a long series of ”  wounds” dating back to the 1990s from the Whitewater scandal to the missing files at the Rose Law Firm. Bossie and Conway charged that the Clinton campaign was in denial about why their candidate had lost    in part their refusal to acknowledge that she was a ”bad candidate.” Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald said the Trump campaign had operated in the world of ”dark arts.” As an example, she flashed the final issue of the National Enquirer, essentially describing Clinton as a corrupt criminal who should be thrown in jail. ”I don’t think you guys give yourself enough credit for the negative campaign you ran,” Grunwald said. ”I think it was an incredibly effective negative campaign, and you guys don’t get credit for it.” To the irritation of Trump officials, the Clinton team argued that the results have not given Trump a mandate to govern. At one point when Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio was saying that the Clinton campaign had failed to understand the fact that 70% of voters believed the country was on the wrong track, her Campaign Manager Robby Mook interrupted: ”We won the popular vote.” Over the course of the   conference, the Clinton team attributed their general election loss to a myriad of factors. They said they faced huge headwinds within the electorate because of the strong desire for change: ”We underestimated the force of that wind of change,” Mook said. But they focused repeatedly on what they viewed as the destructive impact of FBI Director James Comey’s press conference and his two letters about the investigation into Clinton’s emails on her private server. That hurt Clinton particularly among suburban women and younger voters in the final days, they said. ’You guys took everything Donald Trump said so literally’ Clinton advisers also blamed unfair media coverage    noting that it was a struggle every day to get Clinton’s message to break through in a media environment dominated by Trump. There was also fierce criticism of the press by the Trump campaign. One of the odder complaints came from former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. ”This is the problem with the media. You guys took everything Donald Trump said so literally,” Lewandowski said. ”The American people didn’t. They understood it. They understood sometimes when you have a conversation with people, whether it’s around the dinner table or at a bar, you’re going to say things and sometimes you don’t have all the facts to back it up.” Several Clinton advisers also argued that there was an unfair ”double standard” for Clinton within the press that was driven partly by her gender. Mook noted that the press often focused on how she delivered her message in a way that they would not have been scrutinized in a male candidate. ”She’s been an uncomfortable presence for a long time” by breaking gender barriers, Palmieri said. When the Clinton team was asked whether they would have done anything differently, Palmieri said one mistake was not arguing for a fourth debate shortly before the election. When Clinton wasn’t on stage with Trump, it was difficult for her message to break through, she said    setting up a dynamic of ”Hillary versus Hillary.” ”What hurt us was (the Trump campaign) coming after her or the press picking at us,” Palmieri said. Clinton’s advisers said they were harmed by Russians meddling in the election and the ”drip, drip, drip” of news about Hillary Clinton’s emails, followed by the hacking of John Podesta’s emails that revealed internal campaign deliberations. They also acknowledged that they did not perform as well as they needed to among younger voters one key reason for that, they said, was Comey’s interference in the election. ”Undecided voters didn’t break our way,” Mook said of Election Night. ”That Comey letter had a huge effect,” he said, calling it ”probably a  .”   Both Mook and Benenson said while the race was incredibly fluid in the final weeks, they were closely watching both Trump and Clinton defectors    voters who were considering third party candidates. In the final weeks before Election Day, they were coming home    first to Trump and then to Clinton. But the first Comey letter 11 days before the election stalled that movement back to Clinton, Benenson said. ”Those last 11 days we couldn’t get them back,” he said.  Asked about the heated    White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz Friday said he was ”not surprised” that the program was ”particularly” feisty.” Schultz added that he was also ”not sure that’s a bad thing,” saying that it’s important to look back at the decisions of a campaign. ”It’s ok to be candid and to honestly look back at the decisions you made, the decisions your opponent made and how that played out in the context of the race when you’re not in the heat of it,” Schultz said.  Schultz also downplayed stark campaign trail rhetoric between Obama and Trump. ”I think that the President did speak out on the trail early and often about his profound differences with Mr. Trump,” Schultz said. ”But Mr. Trump won. He won the election on November 8th. The President has made clear that our priority in light of that election is to provide for a seamless transition of power.”"
2016-12-03,"The party was like many others in Delmas, a neighborhood in the Haitian capital,    with a vibrant gay community  —   an evening of men in colorful dresses and revealing attire, laughing and catching up. They sipped Prestige beer and   as Beyoncé and Rihanna played in the background. The party stretched into the early morning hours with no end in sight. Then someone knocked on the door. On that March night in 2012, a group of men dressed in black and wearing ski masks forced their way into the apartment. Wilkenson Joseph, then 35, was the closest to the front door. Wearing a red sequin dress, a dark wig, red lipstick and high heels, he was a prime target for the group looking to attack gay men. One of the men stabbed Mr. Joseph in the gut with a knife. His friends picked him up off the floor, blood pouring from his mouth and his side, and rushed him to a hospital. But a doctor demanded $2, 000 before he would provide any care, Mr. Joseph said. For an hour and a half, his friends negotiated a lower rate as he continued to bleed, eventually persuading the doctor to accept $1, 000. Mr. Joseph survived, but he lost his appendix. In a Manhattan office last month, Mr. Joseph recalled his stories of   violence slowly, softly and in French. “After the party,” Mr. Joseph said before trailing off, his eyes closing. There was silence as he summoned the months after that party more than four years ago. He stopped attending parties and dressing up. “It was too traumatic,” he said. “I recoiled from the party scene. I was no longer me. ” Mr. Joseph said it was not the first time he had been attacked because of his sexuality in Haiti, where homosexuality is not a crime, but gay men often hide their orientation to avoid being targeted. A makeup artist for eight years, he had worked at “Journal de Loisirs,” a celebrity talk show, and often carried a purse and makeup bag to the office. Seven months before the stabbing, Mr. Joseph said, he was kidnapped from his workplace, hooded and taken to an abandoned home, where he was chained to a pole and beaten. Three men threatened to kill him, he said, and called him an embarrassment to his country. They later let him go. “I always felt threatened,” he said. “And I never said anything back to these people. I was afraid of a violent response. There was always a fear. ” After the 2012 attack, Mr. Joseph applied for a tourist visa to the United States, hoping the country would be as welcoming as it was portrayed on the television shows he had watched as a child, he said. “It was always my dream country,” Mr. Joseph said. “America is where you can make happen the dreams you envision for yourself. ” He arrived in April 2013 on a tourist visa and settled in New York City. A few weeks later, he attended his first party since the attack, at the Monster, a piano bar in the West Village. Feeling safe, he took the stage to sing “Lumane Casimir,” a   Haitian song. He applied for asylum shortly after moving to the United States, describing in his application the   abuse he endured in Haiti and his fear of returning there. “I feel a lot more comfortable expressing myself here,” he said. “I’ve never feared for my safety here. ” Since his visa expired, he has been working on his immigration status for the past two years with lawyers at Cadwalader, Wickersham  Taft, a law firm in Manhattan. He has applied for asylum and has not received an update. They are awaiting an interview date with immigration services. Mr. Joseph lives on $376 monthly in public assistance, including cash assistance and Medicaid. Through a designation known as PRUCOL, he is able to receive benefits despite not having legal status. Without a job, he has struggled to afford a home, flitting between Florida, New Jersey and New York. Shortly after coming to New York, he found himself on the streets, spending nights riding the subway and shuffling between shelters, always worrying that his visa and passport would be stolen. He found temporary housing in Jamaica, Queens, through Unique People Services, an   supportive housing program. He stayed there for more than a year, but the conditions were dangerous, Mr. Joseph said. Drug activity brought the police often. Once, he said, a neighbor robbed him of $150. Mr. Joseph has found support in Voix Fortes, a   group focused on  . There he met Houda Chergui, a coordinator at the nonprofit ASCNYC, which assists New Yorkers living with and at risk for  . She recommended he seek help through the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. With the help of ASCNYC and the African Services Committee, he was able to move into permanent housing, an apartment in the Bronx, in March the city’s   Services Administration covers his monthly rent of $1, 100. But the apartment was bare. He slept on the floor and had nowhere to sit or eat. In April the federation provided Mr. Joseph with a $1, 000 grant from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy furniture. He decorated his apartment with a sofa bed, a chair and a coffee table. “The furniture made it into a home,” he said. Mr. Joseph, who had dropped out of school in Haiti to support his family after his father’s death, longs to continue his education and get a job as a masseur or as a counselor to help others, while sending some money to his relatives in Haiti. “I want to continue my studies,” he said. “I want to be able to motivate other people in my situation  —   others in the L.

2016-12-04,"  Abrams book publisher announced this week it will honor the ”Bad Little Children’s Books” author’s request to no longer publish his book, following a social media backlash.     ”Satire can be ugly,” Abrams said in a statement on behalf of the author, writing under the pseudonym Arthur C. Gackley. ”However, the book is clearly not being read by some in the way I had intended  —   as satire  —   and, more disturbingly, is being misread as the very act of hate and bigotry that the work was meant to expose, not promote. For this reason, I have asked ABRAMS to cease publishing the book.”  Abrams did not respond to a CNN request to disclose the identity of the author.  ”Bad Little Children’s Books” is a collection of mock children’s book covers that parody   topics like racism and discrimination. At the center of the controversy is the debate on whether the images portrayed in the book are satire or bigotry? One of the book’s online critics called it ”disgusting and utterly racist.”  One cover titled ”Happy Burkaday Timmy!” portrays a girl in a veil holding a ticking present, while another illustrates the ”Rockets and Missiles of the Islamic State.” A different cover paints a Native American family with the title ”The   Kid and the Gift of the Navajo Blanket Riddled With Smallpox.” Illustrations in the book tackle not only race, but also macabre depictions of death or injury and lewd sexual themes, among others. CNN received a copy of the book directly from Abrams Books. The book’s cover features a yellow strip along the joint made to resemble the gold spine of the classic Little Golden Books    except instead of cute animals and flowers, it has skulls, guns, bombs and knives. On the front, the book says it contains parodies, spoofs and ”offensively tweaked covers.” Bigotry or satire? Though it was released in September, the book was thrust into the limelight Friday after the   news blog Book Riot excoriated the tittle for its ”racist, xenophobic and religious bigotry” themes. ”There comes a point when ’funny’ becomes   hate and when that hate is   racist,” wrote former librarian, author and blogger Kelly Jensen. ”This ’humor’ adds to the misinformation, adds to the hatred, and ultimately, makes living in this society more frustrating, difficult, and dangerous for so many. And this ’humor’ is the kind of garbage that needs to be eliminated at all levels, particularly in publishing,” she wrote.  After a Twitterstorm calling for Abrams Books to recall the tittle, the publisher issued a statement Saturday standing by ”Bad Little Children’s Books.” But come Sunday, Abrams Books backpedaled. The publisher defended the book’s publication but said it would respect the author’s request and suspend future publications.   ”Some reviewers and commenters on social media have taken elements of the book at face value, which, we believe, misses the point of the book as a work of artistic parody and satire,” read a company statement, released via Twitter. ”Its intention is to shine a spotlight on stereotypes about race, gender, and difference that have become commonplace in today’s world and to, in fact, skewer all levels of societal bias.” A spokesman for the Council on   Relations, Ibrahim Hooper, called that statement a ”wild” claim. ”It is probably wild that they claim it is to expose intolerance and bigotry,” Hooper said. ”I think it had the opposite effect of promoting it and exploiting it. Bottom line is they have the right to publish this kind of material, but should they? And I think given the divisions we have seen in our society I don’t think it is the best use of the First Amendment.” Freedom of speech, Freedom of speech and responsibility are not mutually exclusive, argued Hooper. He called for tolerance and mutual understanding instead of the ”promotion of hatred and division.” In a public letter, the National Coalition Against Censorship came to Abrams’ defense, asserting ”free expression and intellectual freedom.”  ”We urge the company not to accede to pressure to withdraw the book, but to stand for the proposition that it is the right of authors to write as they choose and of individuals to decide for themselves what to read. After all, anyone who doesn’t like the book doesn’t have to buy it,” the NCAC said in its letter. Abrams President Michael Jacobs sits on the Board of Directors of NCAC.   A ’fine line’ of satire, Satire and bigotry are not mutually exclusive, said Jason Steed, a Texas Supreme Court and appellate attorney and former English professor. He has written about the role humor plays in identity, most recently during the US election. ”We use humor socially to figure out who we fit in with and what groups we are excluded from,” Steed told CNN. He gave the example of two white people making a racist joke while a black person is in the room. ”The two white people can assimilate while alienating the black person. What is the humor doing? People who are offended will feel alienated by the humor. If we find it funny, we are assimilating with the group who is assimilating with the joke,” he explained. Satire however, can get complicated, warns Steed.  ”The humor may not mean to be racist but to mock racism, and that may be some of what they (Abrams) are trying to get at. You push it to some kind of extreme,” he said. But ”there may be a fine line with trying to make a point with satire and really hurting a lot of people. Everyone needs to figure out where the line is and decide what it means to be responsible.”"

2016-12-06,"Senator Rand Paul ( ) was a guest on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily, where he joined SiriusXM host Matt Boyle in critiquing the legacy media’s coverage of the 2016 election. [“You know, I think they’re so openly partisan that I can’t even hardly turn on CNN in the morning, that they’re going on and on about potential conflicts of interest,” Paul said. “Not that they’ve said this is a conflict of interest. They just go on and on and on, so it’s clearly a partisan network, and there’s no news. ”  “During the campaign cycle, they must have spent hours of media time talking about how, ‘No, Donald Trump really wasn’t against the Iraq War because he nodded his head one time during an interview with Howard Stern on a question with the Iraq War,’” Paul recalled. “What they missed by doing that, by being so partisan, what they miss is, there really was a substantive difference between Trump and Clinton on the Iraq War, regime change, and  . ” He noted that “Trump has reiterated, as recently as in the last week or two   …     that we don’t have enough money to build nations overseas we need to rebuild our country. ” “He’s talked about infrastructure here, and this is a profound difference between him and Clinton because you know Clinton kept talking about how she was still for regime change in Syria, getting rid of Assad. She was for regime change in Libya, and Trump was opposed to that, but the media  —   because they’re so partisan  —   never, ever got to that substantial point because they were too busy trying to point out, ‘Oh, we got Donald Trump because he did say at one time he was for the war.’ When in reality, what made the most difference was that he learned the lesson that the Iraq War was a mistake,” Paul said. He said that Trump “won on a different kind of message” and hoped Trump would fill his administration with “people who are consistent with the kind of message he ran on. ” He cited Betsy DeVos as a “good pick” for secretary of education, and Rep. Tom Price ( ) as a good choice for Health and Human Services secretary. Paul said one of Trump’s first tasks should be repealing the “  regulations” put forward by President Obama, which are “chasing American companies overseas. ” “I’d like to see us repeal a hundred regulations in a hundred days, if we could,” he said. “Some of these things can be done by executive order because President Obama put them all in place by executive order. So as much as I’m not a fan of a big, powerful presidency, I am a fan of the presidency undoing the power grabs that the previous president did, and I think they will. All the signs we’ve been hearing is that he’s going to be bold and decisive, and that he will get rid of these   regulations. ” Paul stressed that “lower taxes and less regulations” would be key to making America a competitive business environment and preventing companies from moving jobs overseas. The Senator was humorously frank when Boyle invited him to offer some   advice for the Democrats: “You know, being a partisan, I hope they keep doing what they’re doing because it certainly isn’t working. ”  “They keep   leaders from decades ago,” he noted. “Nancy Pelosi’s been in charge for decades now. She’s been part of the extreme liberal wing of the Democrat Party that is really the wealthy elite. These people are disconnected from the working class. They probably don’t know anybody that’s ever gotten their hands dirty. If they keep appointing and having their leadership be the wealthy elite, I think their disconnect with the American people will only grow, and hopefully those of us who want more freedom to go back to the individual and to the states, I think we’ll keep winning as long as they keep the old elite guard in place. ” Paul said the Republican Party has taken the lead because it has “connected the working class to the small businessperson, to those who are American business versus people who leave us and go overseas. ” “I’ve always said that that’s when we become the dominant party, and that’s when we connect the worker to the boss, and say, you know what, we’re not going to have a shrinking American pie. We’re not going to have a smaller economy where you have to grab yours before somebody else grabs their share. What we want is an expanding American pie, where workers and business owners and everyone is enjoying a bigger slice of the pie because the economy is growing,” he said. “I think we can grow like crazy,” Paul predicted. “We’ve been limping along under the Obama economy at like maybe 1 percent growth, if we’re lucky. If we really do cut taxes, if we cut the corporate income tax and cut the regulatory burden, this economy is ready to really grow and create millions of jobs. So I think you’ll see not only a transformation of the political landscape, but I think we’re poised to see a transformation of our economy, where we could really be a vibrant nation that leads the world in job creation. ” He advised his fellow Republicans to be on guard against the “giddiness” that can come when a single party controls the White House and both houses of Congress, and to remember what the party stands for. “We are a party that not only believes in lower taxes and less regulation we’re a party that believes, and says we believe, in balancing the budget,” he noted. “No matter who proposes it, I’ll continue to be an advocate for balancing the budget. I’ll continue to be somebody  —   and I may be alone in this  —   but I won’t vote for budgets that never balance. We’re going to have a fight early on in January. People want to repeal Obamacare, and so do I, but I want to repeal it passing a budget that actually is a fiscally conservative budget that balances. Right now, the tussle in the Senate is, people want to pass any old budget, whether it ever balances or not, whether it’s fiscally conservative or not. They just want to get it done because they’re going to then use that to repeal Obamacare. ”  “I’m a physician. I hate Obamacare. I want to do anything we can to get rid of it. But at the same time, I’m not willing to vote for a budget, even if it’s a Republican budget, that never balances and is not fiscally conservative,” Paul declared.

2016-12-07,"Here’s the problem with feminism: it makes the holidays very hard. Particularly when it comes to  . Of course, most women are content with something pink and expensive under the Christmas tree. But what about those feminists who demand presents that don’t prop up the patriarchy, gifts that don’t give in to gender stereotypes, trinkets that don’t trade in transmisogyny and objects that don’t objectify? It’s a minefield, basically  —   and one you should tread carefully. Everyone knows feminists don’t have a sense of humour.  Thankfully, there are already numerous gift guides tailored to the feminist in your life  —   you know, as opposed to all those other women who are not interested in   rights. According to these guides,   presents include a Uterus Plush Figure (“an informative tag describes the wonders of the womb”) a $155 (£122) Vagina Charm Necklace a   iPhone case and period pants. These are all bloody good suggestions, don’t get me wrong. Sometimes, however, a feminist just has more vagina charm necklaces than she knows what to do with. So I’ve helpfully put together a few more ideas to help you close the gift gap this December.  Definitions of feminism can differ so it’s worth quickly recapping what the   actually means. Pat Robertson, an American televangelist, might have said it best when he  described feminism as a movement that “encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practise witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians”. Now, I hate to make sweeping generalisations, but if you’re going to practise witchcraft, then you’re going to need a broomstick. If you’re a feminist but don’t have a   proclaiming you’re a feminist, are you really a feminist? Probably not. Women have never had so much freedom to purchase hideous   that let the world know that they truly do buy into feminism. With slogans such as “Girls just wanna have   human rights” “Who needs gender roles when we can have pizza rolls?” or “Ovaries before Brovaries” you can show the world how important it is to have equal access to terrible puns. The bigger, the better. What, did you think the patriarchy was going to topple itself?  If you like feminism, you should put a ring on it. More specifically, you should put a pinky ring on it. Fred+Far, an   jewellery company, offers a “  pinky ring” billed as an   ring. “Woman,” the website says, “reclaim yourself   …     choose power, choose fulfilment, choose choice   …     choose yourself. ” If you think this sounds like some grade A bullshit rather than Serious Feminism, I’d caution you not to be so cynical and have a little feminist faith. Buy a $325 (£256) pinky ring and equal rights will undoubtedly follow. Don’t let anyone tell you that makeup is a foundation of patriarchal oppression makeup is war paint. Suffragettes suffered for our right to go to Sephora and we should celebrate this freedom, not debate it. In case you still need convincing that eyeliner won’t ruin your feminist credentials, may I remind you that the Nigerian writer and feminist role model, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, is a beauty ambassador for Boots No. 7. In a recent interview regarding this role, Adichie says that she wanted to be “part of the message that women who like makeup also have important and serious things that they’re doing in their lives   …     it’s time to really stop that ridiculous idea that somehow if you’re a serious woman you can’t and should not care about how you look. ” So there you go: makeup still maketh you a feminist. A( wo) men to that. It may be the holidays but feminists need to stay awake. "
2016-12-08,"The W. K. Kellogg Foundation, the namesake nonprofit arm of the Kellogg Company, has given $310, 000 to the   community organizing group Causa Justa :: Just Cause, an open border   immigration group. Causa Justa :: Just Cause also has connections to a group called the Freedom Road Socialist Organization that promotes breaking the United States up into   nation states. [The W. K. Kellogg Foundation gave $10, 000 to Causa Justa :: Just Cause in   to “enable the organization to achieve its mission by providing general operating support. ”  Later, the Foundation gave $300, 000 to Causa Justa :: Just Cause in a grant slated to last from 2012 to 2014 that was designed to: Engage communities in   racial healing in order to mobilize for foreclosure prevention creating neighborhood stabilization for   and Latino families, The terms “engage” and “mobilize” are often leftist doublespeak for the sort of disruptive community organizing agitation and protests that groups like Causa Justa :: Just Cause engage in. A basic search of Causa Justa :: Just Cause’s history makes clear the sort of “mission” to which the W. K. Kellogg’s Foundation’s grant was providing “operating support. ” In 2011, Causa Justa :: Just Cause partnered with the radical Oakland chapter of the Occupy Wall Street movement to protest and “occupy” houses. As David Bacon wrote at LaborPress. org in 2011: Activists from Causa Justa :: Just Cause and Occupy Oakland protested foreclosures, and demanded that banks stop foreclosures and allow families to move into foreclosed and vacant homes in Oakland. The action was one of over two dozen carried out by Occupy activists and supporters across the country to protest foreclosures and the refusal of banks to renegotiate loans. After a march, people occupied a home owned by Fannie Mae, and announced they would make it a community center, as part of an effort to force Fannie Mae to allow people to live in the many vacant homes it owns as a result of foreclosures. In front of the occupied home, poets recited, activists made speeches, and neighbors poured through the gates. Causa Justa :: Just Cause also worked to expand San Francisco’s “Sanctuary City” law in the wake of the death of Kate Steinle, a young woman killed in July 2015 by   deportee illegal alien Francisco  . Steinle’s death led to condemnation of San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy, but Causa Justa :: Just Cause was a leader in pushing the San Francisco city council to actually expand its sanctuary city policies. Last May, a woman with Causa Justa :: Just Cause tried to block this reporter from filming the group’s members as they violated the rules at a San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting. They then caused my illegal removal from the public meeting. One member of the Causa Justa’s Board of Directors is Michelle Foy, a prominent member of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, a   group of “ ” who believe that capitalism “is inherently a system of inequality, injustice, and war. ” Here is how they describe their intellectual and ideological role models: The primary theoreticians of   are Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. We also value the contributions of other socialists such as Amilcar Cabral, Fidel Castro, and Ho Chi Minh who applied Marxism to their own conditions. We seek to learn from   in the United States, such as William Z. Foster and Harry Haywood. Communists can also learn from revolutionary nationalists such as Malcolm X. Theory derives from social practice. We seek to grow from every new lesson our activism in all social movements teaches us. The Freedom Road Socialist Organization also chimed in on the murder of Kate Steinle. An essay on their website by Joe Navarro claimed that the death of Kate Steinle gave “a soap box for Trump and his supporters to promote an   agenda. ” Navarro urged his fellow activists to counter efforts to end San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy. He wrote: People must demand that this incident be treated as a criminal investigation, and that Francisco   be given his right to a fair and impartial investigation and followed up with a fair trial. Additionally, the sanctuary cities policies should not be undermined or eliminated. Local police agencies should not automatically hand over undocumented immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I. C. E. aka La Migra) to be detained for deportation. It is not the duty of local police agencies to act as immigration agents. Lastly, people should demand a just immigration policy that allows honest working people to live and work in the U. S. with a path to citizenship. The Freedom Road Socialist Organization also actively supports splitting up America into separate nations based on race. Under their plan, black people would get the southeastern USA while Chicanos would get the southwestern states. They write on their website: We support   for the   nation. As this struggle gains momentum, this may eventually include the establishment of an independent   nation based in the South. We defend the right to independent   organization necessary to achieve this liberation, including the right to separate   revolutionary parties. As a result of historical developments since the annexation of Mexican land by the United States, there emerged an oppressed   nation of Aztlan. Since annexation, there has been a continuous struggle for land and justice (tierra y libertad). We support the right to   up to and including secession for that nation. We defend the right to independent   organization necessary to achieve this liberation, including the right to separate   parties. We support struggles of national liberation for all other nations brutalized by imperialist oppression whose homelands are within the borders of the United States, such as the Native American nations of the US, the Hawai’ian nation and the Puerto Rican struggle for national independence.

2016-12-09,"A source at the Fox News Channel tells Breitbart News that staff at the network hope Megyn Kelly will leave soon. [“Everybody in the building is sick of it. We absolutely can’t stand it anymore,” the source said.  “This ‘all me, all the time’ tour, ‘I’m the victim,’ ‘I’m going to be poisoned,’ is getting really old. ” (The “poisoned” remark refers to rumors that Kelly had been poisoned before the first presidential debate in 2015  —   a rumor she appears to deny in her new memoir, Settle for More.) The source added: “Go. We don’t care. Leave. You want to be friends with Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon? Go to CNN. Have fun. ” There are rumors that Kelly may leave for CNN  —   and Vanity Fair reported Thursday that Kelly is also considering a move to ABC. In both cases, she is rumored to be considering salary offers less than the $20 million that Fox has reportedly offered her to stay, in exchange for more advantageous working conditions. There are also worries at Fox about Kelly’s book sales, according to the source. After debuting at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list in   Kelly’s memoir has fallen to #4 in just a few weeks, and sold fewer than 150, 000 units through its first three weeks, according to the most recent figures available from Publishers Weekly. HarperCollins  —   which, like Fox News, is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation  —   paid Kelly a reported $6 million advance. The source told Breitbart News that Kelly’s sales figures were disappointing: “For someone with a profile, that’s a disaster, an unmitigated disaster. It’s the biggest loser since Hillary Clinton’s book [Hard Choices]. ” Kelly, the source added, “loses a million viewers from O’Reilly. She’s clearly the weakest link in the lineup. ” Joel B.

2016-12-10,"  Day by contentious day,   Donald Trump is building a White House Cabinet and staffing a new government. But if his first round of choices are any indication, he’s going forward without a blueprint    relying on instincts and personal relationships over any grand design scheme or ideology. Trump’s nominees range from a treasury secretary who spent nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street giant Trump the candidate frequently ripped as a den of corruption and cronyism, to a potential defense department chief who opposes the use of torture tactics his   boss called for during the campaign. His choices to lead the EPA and Department of Education support policies that would render their own agencies toothless or see them eliminated. During the campaign, Trump pledged to ”drain the swamp”    or keep the familiar Washington, DC, insiders outside the halls of federal power. But wealthy, connected donors and bankers are grabbing up influential positions in the new administration. Rather than lobbyists, Trump has been seeking to hire their bosses.  Here is a rundown of the nominees, some for Cabinet positions and others for administrative jobs, and how they mix with Trump’s public policy pledges.  Secretary of State, Trump: If he’s not a fan, then Trump certainly has nicer things to say about the Russian government, and its strongman President Vladimir Putin, than most in politics and the US government. ”The man has very strong control over his country,” Trump said admiringly in September, and often muses on improving bilateral relations with Moscow. And if that didn’t complicate matters enough, there’s now bipartisan concern, based on secret assessments provided by the CIA, that Russia sought to aid Trump and damage Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Rex Tillerson: After flirting with Putin critic Mitt Romney for weeks, Trump shifted his affections toward ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, whom he selected on Tuesday. Tillerson has done extensive business with the Kremlin and was awarded the the Order of Friendship by the Russian president in 2013.  That came two years after the oil executive and Putin negotiated a   dollar deal that would have opened up Russia’s arctic ice fields to joint exploration. But new US sanctions, imposed in response to Moscow’s meddling in Crimea and Ukraine, froze the project indefinitely. Romney’s relationship with the Russians is less chummy. He was skewered for it at the time, but the 2012 GOP presidential nominee called Russia ”without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.”  That Tillerson, who is expected to face a serious confirmation fight, and Romney were ever in the running for the same job is odd and suggests Trump’s foreign policy is either inchoate, inscrutable    or both. Secretary of Energy, Trump: A questionnaire circulated by his transition team set off concerns the new administration would target staffers who opposed Trump’s climate skepticism.  The document requests the names of department employees and contractors who have attended outside climate change meetings and any writings derived from those gatherings.  Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry: Like Trump, Perry is   on climate questions. He is a supporter of the fossil fuel industry and pledged during his brief 2016 campaign to revive construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, but during his time as governor also invested in renewable energy projects. Perry is no fan of the department he would run. He campaigned in 2012 on a promise to shutter it, along with Commerce and Education, though during a now infamous debate stage gaffe, could not    Oops!    recall its name. Secretary of Treasury, Trump: ”I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over (Ted Cruz). Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton,” he said during the campaign,   And in an election eve ad, a video clip of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein rolls as Trump, in a voiceover, talks of defeating ”a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.”  Steve Mnuchin: A former partner at Goldman Sachs, he worked at the company for 17 years before briefly joining a hedge fund and then buying a subprime lending company which would be questioned by regulators over predatory foreclosure practices. He has also worked with the liberal billionaire George Soros, a bogeyman to many on the right, who see his fingerprints    often without or in opposition to any evidence    on every protest of policy push. Soros, like Blankfein, also had a cameo in that final campaign video. Secretary of Defense, Trump: Repeatedly pledged to bring back torture during stump speeches, in which he described a stark but vague plan of action against ISIS.  In February, Trump said: ”Torture works. OK, folks? You know, I have these guys    ”Torture doesn’t work!”    believe me, it works. And waterboarding is your minor form. Some people say it’s not actually torture. Let’s assume it is. But they asked me the question: What do you think of waterboarding? Absolutely fine. But we should go much stronger than waterboarding.” Trump has also spoken in wild, if   terms, about fighting ISIS. ”I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me,” he said at a campaign event. ”I would bomb the    out of them.” James Mattis: Despite courting controversy in 2005 when he told servicemembers ”it’s fun to shoot some people,” the recently retired marine general has also spoken at length about the ISIS threat. In 2014, he delivered a nuanced analysis to Congress on the group’s growth and how they should be combated. He urged against ruling out ”boots on the ground” but also said the Obama administration needed to be more specific about its goals.  As Trump himself said following a conversation with Mattis, the military man does not support torture techniques. ”I met with him at length and I asked him that question,” the   told the New York Times. ”I said, ’What do you think of waterboarding?’ He said    I was surprised    he said, ’I’ve never found it to be useful.’ He said, ’I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture. ’” Secretary of Health and Human Services, Trump: Says he wants to repeal Obamacare, but with a number of caveats.  In an interview with ”60 Minutes” after the election, Trump said he wanted to keep provisions that guarantee coverage to people with   conditions    ”It happens to be one of the strongest assets. It adds cost, but it’s very much something we’re gonna try and keep”    and allow parents to keep their children on their policies until the age of 26.  He also guaranteed that the law would be ”repealed and replaced” with no gap between the two    not a ”two day” or ”two year period where there’s nothing.” Tom Price: Also wants to repeal Obamacare, but has no interest in keeping any specific element or simply amending the original. Price, though, unlike many of his Republican House colleagues, has a thorough plan to replace it with a program that relies on tax credits for insurance seekers on the individual market and an emphasis on Health Savings Accounts. People with   conditions would likely be clustered in   pools. The Price plan would also end the expanded Medicaid funding some states have accepted as part of Obamacare. On balance, experts say his plan would be a boon for healthy and wealthy, but reduce aid to the elderly and those who are already sick or in need. Secretary of Commerce, Trump: Pledged to bring jobs back to the manufacturing sector in part by renegotiating international trade deals like NAFTA. Trump also focused relentlessly on China’s market activities, including allegations that their government had artificially undervalued its currency    a way of boosting exports and cutting down on imports.    Wilbur Ross: The billionaire private equity firm man told CNN’s ”Erin Burnett Outfront” that an effort to redraw NAFTA would be ”a logical starting point” once he arrived on the job. And like Trump, he has been critical of China, saying that the country ”is the world’s biggest exporter, but they’re also the people with one of the highest tariffs on imports in the whole world. That seems a little bit oxymoronic.” Ross boosted his fortune in the early 2000s by buying up sinking steelmakers, creating the International Steel Group, then selling it off a couple years later for $4. 5 billion. Of all Trump’s picks, Ross stands out as perhaps the most ideologically   choice.    Environmental Protection Agency  Trump: In a 2012 tweet, said that ”the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U. S. manufacturing  ” and has expressed doubt over tmore recently about climate science. But he met with former Vice President Al Gore, this week and hedged his position in a   interview with the New York Times, saying, ”I think there is some connectivity (between activity and climate change). Some, something. It depends on how much.” Scott Pruitt: While Trump’s comments on the matter are open to interpretation, the Oklahoma attorney general’s are not. He is a prominent climate science denier and a frequent critic of the agency he will lead if confirmed. In a piece he   for the National Review in May, Pruitt announced he would challenge Obama’s Clean Power Plan    proposed in tandem with the White House by the EPA    in court.  Though Pruitt cannot completely shutter the EPA or unilaterally cancel many of its regulations, he could accept diminished budgets and drastically diminish its influence. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Trump: Spoke during the campaign only in vague terms about the troubles of America’s ”inner cities,” usually framing them as part of an appeal to  . ”We will make your streets safe so when you walk down the street, you don’t get shot, which is happening now,” he said in August    an phrase he returned to in the first debate, when told viewers that ”  Hispanics, are living in hell.” Ben Carson: The celebrated brain surgeon has no experience in government, a fact his business manager cited and attributed to Carson as his reasoning for not initially accepting an administration job. Carson has also never lived in public housing, despite being raised in poverty in Detroit.  In his limited public comments about HUD policy, he has been mostly critical of its activities. Carson disparaged 1970s busing programs meant to desegregate city schools as one of a series of ”failed socialist experiments” in a Washington Times   from July 2015. He also fretted that the Obama HUD’s use of the Fair Housing Act to tie federal funds to the construction of affordable housing in wealthier enclaves would ”change the nature of some communities.”  Secretary of Labor  Trump: Has pivoted, twisted and reversed himself repeatedly on the question of raising the minimum wage. Trump said he supported raising the federal number to $10 but, in earlier interviews, suggested it should be a question for the states. At a GOP primary debate, he said that wages in the country are ”too high” and he would not raise the floor.  Politifact rated Trump’s position as a ”Full Flop.” Andrew Puzder: The CEO of fast food chains Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, Puzder is a stalwart opponent of the progressive push for greater regulation of the industry and the move to a $15 minimum wage.  In a Wall Street Journal   from March, he argued that ”dramatic increases in labor costs have a significant effect on the restaurant industry, where profit margins are pennies on the dollar and labor makes up about a third of total expenses,” and said that ramped up expenses like a minimum wage hike would push corporations toward automation    and in so doing eliminate jobs entirely. Secretary of Homeland Security, Trump: Used the campaign season to push alarmist rhetoric about the threat of Islamic extremism inside US borders, at times proposing a temporary ban on the immigration of the Muslims into the country and flirting with the creation of Muslim registry. Trump isn’t talking about a ban on Muslims traveling to the US *anymore* but his transition team has expressed interest in a program similar to one enacted by the George W. Bush administration and met early on after the election with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped build the since disbanded NSEERS program (National Security   program). NSEERS focused on countries, not individuals, and did not block immigration. But it added an extra layer of screening for people from almost exclusively   nations    or any the administration deemed  . John Kelly: Another retired Marine general, Kelly was the former head of the US Southern Command, which meant he administered the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. Kelly opposed Obama’s efforts to close the camp, which Trump supports, telling the Military Times in an interview, ”There are no innocent men down there.” But unlike the   Kelly is more careful in his comments about the Muslim community. Speaking to NPR in December 2015, he described ISIS as being powered by a ”corrupted Islamic view of life” and ”truly not representative of Islam.” ”The vast majority of Muslims are wonderful people,” he added, ”whether they live here in the United States or overseas.” Secretary of Education, Trump: Has been difficult to read on the   of education policy, at points suggesting the department could be eliminated altogether. On his website, Trump promises to ”immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice”    or private and charter schools. He also says that Congress should pass reforms to assure colleges and universities are making ”a good faith effort” to reduce the costs and student debt ”in exchange for the federal tax breaks and tax dollars.” Trump is an opponent of Common Core standards, which has called a ”disaster” and pledge to discontinue. Betsy DeVos: A billionaire Republican donor and school choice activist, DeVos has, unlike Trump, been a supporter of Common Core, one of the reasons her nomination raised eyebrows on the right as well as tempers on the left. Critics note that DeVos has sought to push voucher systems    funded with taxpayer bucks    that would funnel students to private schools, undermining and draining the lifeblood from public schools.  Secretary of Transportation, Trump: Made infrastructure spending a focus point during the campaign and will now seek to negotiate funding from a   Congress loathe to spend on public projects. During the campaign, Trump said he wanted $1 billion to rebuild American roads, bridges, airports, rail systems, hospitals and other critical infrastructure as a means of creating jobs now and boosting furture growth. Elaine Chao: A former labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration, she is the daughter of a wealthy shipping family and wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Chao has also worked as a banker in New York and San Francisco. In this role, she would likely be working in close quarters with McConnell as the White House tries to help maneuver legislation to fund Trump’s infrastructure spending ambitions. Attorney General  Trump: Pledged as a candidate to bring back ”law and order,” which in political speak usually translates to tougher policing and crackdowns on activists and protesters. It was a rallying cry during the 1960s, when former President Richard Nixon used the phrase as a coded nod to White southerners angered by the progress of the Civil Rights era.    Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions: A former US for the Southern District of Alabama and Alabama attorney general, Sessions’ appointment to the federal bench was blocked in 1986 after an   former colleague testified he had called him ”boy” and expressed past sympathies for the Ku Klux Klan.  Sessions disputed the allegations, but his nomination was scuttled by the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which he now sits. He has also spoken out against the Voting Rights Act, called the NAACP and ACLU ”” accusing the groups of having ”forced civil rights down the throats of people.” Small Business Administration, Trump: Put forward a plan that would cut business tax rates across the board, reducing the rate to 15% for both major corporations and smaller firms. Linda McMahon:  The former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment helped turn a relatively small operation into a global goliath. In the process, though, the WWE has developed a reputation for its fierce efforts to preserve what is effectively a monopoly on pro wrestling by swatting down potential competitors    or small businesses."

Chinese people make up about 23% of the population and Indian people about 7%.” ”Another 12% is comprised of hundreds of indigenous groups, including native groups from Malaysia’s two states on the island of Borneo, bordering Indonesia.” ”Islam is Malaysia’s official religion, and all Malays are Muslim by law. About 61% of the country is Muslim, with Buddhism, Christianity, and Hinduism comprising most of the rest of the population, according to the CIA.” ”Malaysia’s diversity results in an unmistakable blend of religion, food, language, and culture.” ”Malaysia’s history is rife with ethnic tension that influences its politics. ” ”A  in 1969 led to the New Economic Policy, a government measure aimed at reducing inequalities between Malays and the richer Chinese class.

But the prime minister can force an early election by dissolving the Parliament at any time, effectively controlling which day the election falls.” ”In 2013, the year of Malaysia’s most recent election, many Malaysians feared Prime Minister Najib Razak would schedule the election on a holiday weekend, in an effort to repress turnout among supporters of the growing opposition coalition. That didn’t end up being the case, although the ruling party still narrowly won in a contentious decision.” ’The same political coalition has ruled Malaysia since its independence in 1957.’ ’The Malaysian state of Penang, and particularly its capital George Town, is considered one of the best destinations for street food in Asia, if not the world.’ ”Take a stroll through George Town and you’ll pass hundreds of hawker stalls offering everything from samosas to spicy noodle curry to cendol, a dessert made from sweet grass jelly and coconut milk.” ’Penang cuisine is heavily influenced by the   a unique subgroup whose food is a hybrid of Chinese, Malay, Thai, and other Southeast Asian groups.’ ’Their signature dish is asam laksa  —   a bowl of silky rice noodles served in a sour, spicy,   mackerel soup, and often topped with onion, pineapple, mint, ginger, and shrimp paste.

2016-12-13,"Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson,   Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, will have his Senate confirmation hearing in January. Before then, experts say, he’ll have to think hard about how to divest from a company where he has spent his entire career. Tillerson reportedly owns 2. 6 million shares of Exxon Mobil stock, which would be worth about $240 million, as of the Wall Street close on Tuesday. When John Kerry became secretary of state nearly four years ago, he and his wife, Teresa Heinz, divested from a long list of companies to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest. For the same reason, George Shultz  —   an executive at Bechtel before serving as Ronald Reagan’s top diplomat  —   set up a blind trust, says Davis Robinson, the State Department’s legal adviser at the time. But, Robinson says, ”his was not as complicated as Mr. Tillerson, because Mr. Tillerson owns so much of Exxon Mobil stock.” Blind trusts and divestment are two of the most common options to meet the requirements of federal ethics laws. And tax breaks allow wealthy appointees to defer   taxes when they sell off assets so they can serve in government. Paul Light, the Paulette Goddard Professor of Public Service at New York University, says divestment is the most effective cure to conflict of interest concerns. ”If you are to reassure the public that your negotiations with foreign governments have no tie to your financial interests, you divest,” he says. For Tillerson, that may not be enough. Even if he divests from Exxon Mobil stock, he will face tough questions on Capitol Hill about his past dealings, especially in Russia. Tillerson opposed U. S. sanctions on Russia, imposed after Russia annexed Crimea, that slowed a joint project between Exxon Mobil and Russian energy giant Rosneft to drill in the Arctic. ”It troubles me greatly that Mr. Tillerson would have reason to advocate for the rolling back of sanctions because that would be the best interests of his company,” says Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ”And it is my hope that he’s enough of a patriot to separate his   affiliation with this major oil company and the genuine interest of the American people.” Russia isn’t the only place of concern, Coons says. ”I suspect we will be having discussions about a number of different countries where he negotiated relationships or deals with dictators or authoritarian regimes that worked for Exxon Mobil, but will not work for America’s interests,” he says. Edward Verona, a former Exxon Mobil colleague of Tillerson’s in Russia, now with McLarty Associates in Washington, D. C. believes the oil executive will be able to make the switch to the State Department. ”I don’t believe that he would, certainly not consciously, do anything that would contravene the interests of the United States for the potential benefit of his former company. That’s just my sense of him,” he says. Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, says he will chair a confirmation hearing for Tillerson in early January. But before the nominee meets with any senators, he’ll need to answer the committee’s questionnaire about whether and how he will sever his business relationships with Exxon Mobil."
2016-12-14," The head of U. S. forces fighting Islamic State said on Wednesday the United States may target weapons seized by the group when it captured the Syrian city of Palmyra, adding the equipment posed a danger to the U. S.  coalition in the region. Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend told a Pentagon video briefing that the weapons seized by Islamic State likely included armored vehicles, guns and possibly air defense equipment or other heavy weaponry. He hoped Russia or Syria would quickly retake Palmyra and neutralize the threat, but cautioned the United States would stand ready to strike if needed, including if the looted weapons started moving out of the city. ”Basically anything they seized poses a threat to the coalition but we can manage those threats and we will,” Townsend said. ”I anticipate that we’ll have opportunities to strike that equipment and kill the ISIL that’s operating it soon.” Still, he cautioned that Russia or Syria would have a far better sense of who was on the ground and would be in a better position to react quickly. ”We can’t tell one side from the other. So we can’t tell if the truck and the armored vehicle is being operated by a regime trooper, a Russian trooper or ISIL fighter,” he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. Islamic State recaptured the ancient city of Palmyra on Sunday despite dozens of Russian air strikes to push back the militants, exposing the limitations of the Russian backing that has turned the tide of the conflict in Syrian President Bashar  ’s favor.  The focus of Syria’s overstretched army on defeating insurgents in their last urban stronghold of Aleppo may have diverted resources needed to defend the city, where Moscow in recent months beefed up its defenses. Palmyra, with its   city and spectacular ruins, had been recaptured from the militants last March, in what was hailed as a major victory for the government and the biggest reversal for Islamic State in Syria since Russia’s intervention. ’FLEETING VICTORY’ ”(They) took their eye off the ball there, the enemy sensed weakness and struck and gained a victory that I think will probably be fleeting,” Townsend said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that if it were true the militants seized an   missile system, the threat from Islamic State ”is worse because of the failed strategy of the Syrians and the Russians.” By taking full control of Aleppo, Assad has proved the power of his military coalition and dealt a crushing blow to rebel hopes of ousting Assad after revolting against him during the 2011 Arab uprisings.  Rebels have been supported by the United States, Turkey and Gulf monarchies, but the support they have enjoyed has fallen far short of the direct military backing given to Assad by Russia and Iran. Townsend said he expected rebels who lost Aleppo would take their fight elsewhere in Syria but that it was unlikely to significantly affect the U. S.  effort against Islamic State   including a bid to capture the group’s stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. ”Our estimate is they’ll probably go somewhere else that is more important to them, and I won’t care to comment on where we think that might be,” he said.  (Reporting by Phil Stewart and David Alexander; Editing by Peter Cooney) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ”declaration of war” which could trigger clashes within days.

Travel writer and Pokémon Go enthusiast Darmon Richter braved a trip to the Chernobyl exclusion zone  —   the site of a 1986 nuclear disaster  —   to hunt for the fictional digital avatars. Richter was curious about Pokémon Go activity in unconventional areas after learning people were  “I found the game had the effect of stripping away politics from what included some highly contested sites. Ukraine even has recently passed a law that makes the production of communist symbols illegal  —   but they still feature in Pokémon Go,” Richter told Barcroft. “I was already booked to lead a photography tour into Chernobyl in September, so I downloaded the app and decided to go and investigate,” he added. Richter and a local tour guide took an overnight trip to the ghost town, where an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Pripyat on April 26, 1986, forced the evacuation of 50, 000 residents. Not only were dozens killed, but several more died from illnesses related to the disaster in the years following. “The radiation levels are high enough that you wouldn’t want to live there  —   but for an overnight trip, it’s safe enough. We just had to keep an eye on the radiation meter and avoid any hot spot,” Richter told Barcroft, adding that he was able to find a couple of Pokémon along the way. Chernobyl wasn’t the only controversial stop the gamer made. He also whipped out his smartphone in historic areas of Bulgaria and Kiev. “I had to be careful that my own behavior wasn’t likely to cause offense. In some places, I wouldn’t have felt comfortable playing at all  —   such as the Holodomor Genocide Memorial in Kiev, which now features as a gym in Pokémon Go,” Richter told Barcroft. Richter believes that exploring histories with troubled pasts could become a new trend in gaming. “The game broke taboos, and valued objects of communist heritage with equal weight to more conventional attractions,” Richter said. “It hints at a growing cultural shift towards the depoliticization of   ideological architecture, even in countries where that history is still now a subject of division,” he added."
2016-12-16,"In 2008, NPR gathered more than a dozen voters in a York, Pa. hotel. They had dinner and got to know one another, and over the course of several meetings that fall they spent hours sharing their views on an often uncomfortable subject: race. The York Project culminated when the voters gathered after Barack Obama’s victory. Obama supporters were exultant. Some who voted for Republican John McCain had mixed feelings. They were excited about the historic moment but disappointed in the result. Now, after a very different election, Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep traveled back to York to follow up with four of those people. Their lives and their city have changed. Some of their viewpoints have changed, too. Yet this time, those whose candidate lost in 2008 were now on the winning side. Pennsylvania mattered in this election. The swing state helped decide the result. And York County went decisively for   Donald Trump. When we gathered four of the ’08 participants in York’s Colonial Courthouse, they shared a range of ideas about what led to Trump’s victory  —   and what kind of future his presidency might hold. (If your browser supports Flash, read more about the original York Project voters here. To hear Morning Edition’s followup conversation, click on the audio above.) Below, the four York Project voters who sat down with us again. Cal Weary, 42, 2008: High school drama teacher voted for Obama, 2016: Owner of a business that promotes arts education voted for Hillary Clinton, Hear his 2016 profile. Weary, a registered Republican, crossed party lines in 2008 to vote for Obama. At the same time, he asserted in 2008 that any black advance causes some white people to feel like something is torn away from them. He says he sees Trump supporters who try to distance themselves from the white supremacists who also backed him. Even if other Trump voters don’t consider themselves racist, he says, they are in essence enabling racism. ”I think that they definitely are saying that it’s not that big a deal to them,” he says. Weary suffered a heart attack just before the 2016 election, an event he now sees as a metaphor. ”You could kind of look at what just happened to us, was kind of like a heart attack,” he says. ”Now we’re at a point of, I mean, do we have another one? Or do we start therapy?” 2008: 2016: Sarah Yacoviello, 39, 2008: Former teacher voted for McCain, 2016: Works in development for a nonprofit voted for Trump, Hear her 2016 profile. Yacoviello was a reluctant McCain supporter, and says she again had serious reservations this time around  —   so much so that, until now, only her family knew she supported Trump. That Trump is not your typical politician is refreshing, she says  —   but she sighs when asked if he’s a role model, and says no. Instead, her support for Trump ultimately came down to his promises to cut taxes and reduce regulations on business owners. As someone who works in fundraising for charities, Yacoviello sees how policies helping affluent businesses end up affecting everyone else. ”The working class needs [philanthropists] and our country needs them,” she says. Yacoviello says that, although she thought in 2008 that McCain better reflected her conservative values, she has grown to like Obama. ”He’s a good man, he was a good husband, he was a good father, a good statesman, a good spokesman for our country,” she says. ”It’s hard as a conservative to say these things, but I really do have a great deal of respect for him.” 2008: 2016: Margie Orr, 71, 2008: Receptionist voted for Barack Obama, 2016: York City School Board president voted for Hillary Clinton, Hear her 2016 profile. Back in 2008, Orr predicted the system wouldn’t be fair to Obama because he was black. Eight years later, she thinks she was right. ”He’s had a rough time of it, with the other party coming into office,” she says. ”He’s tried his best with him being who he is. I think he’s been an excellent president  —   a very good, excellent role model.” And she’s sure he was opposed because of the color of his skin  —   even though his mom was white. ”The country wasn’t prepared to have a black president,” Orr says. ”It’s   to me, because he’s half of everybody  —   but any percentage of blackness that you have within yourself, you face racial conditions.” Even though he had a white mother and was raised by her parents, she says, ”he’s still black, and there lies the problem.” 2008: 2016: Don Gettys, 74, 2008: Constable voted for John McCain, 2016: Constable voted for Donald Trump, Hear his 2016 profile. Gettys says York, an old manufacturing town, has been through tough times  —   but right now, his hometown is on the upswing. ”There’s new businesses downtown, they’re trying to get more people downtown,” he says. ”I think there’s been a lot of improvements.” Though Obama was not his guy in 2008, Gettys appreciates the work the president has done to open up U. S.  relations, but he does not like ”some of the immigration that’s gone on.” The appeal in Trump, Gettys says, is that the country will be run like a business. ”I just hope he gets the country back together and gets rid of the divisiveness and gets everybody on the same page,” Gettys says. 2008: 2016:"
2016-12-17,"Just days before the Electoral College is slated to hold its vote, Harvard law professor and progressive activist Larry Lessig conceded that as of today, only a “handful” of electors will likely ultimately vote against Donald Trump unless the number of electors who pledge to do so climbs above 40. [Lessig   a group called the Electors Trust, which is leading a   effort to stop Trump from becoming president by providing legal representation to renegade electors and offering them a confidential space to air their intentions.  Speaking in an interview set to air Sunday on this reporter’s national weekend talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” Lessig commented on a claim he made last week that 20 Republican electors are considering voting against Trump. In the interview, which was recorded on Friday, Lessig cited other activists working to impact the Electoral College vote as claiming that the number of electors thinking about casting ballots for other politicians instead of Trump could be as high as 32 Republicans. Lessig admitted that unless that number climbs to 40 the effort is doomed to fail: “But I think that we are not going to see more than a handful who actually vote against Donald Trump unless that number climbs above 40. Because I think there are many people who think it is just not worth it given especially the pretty explicit threats that have been made against the electors who exercise their constitutional prerogative. ” The claim of 32 electors waffling on their votes could not be substantiated since so far only one Republican elector, Chris Suprun, has announced publicly he will vote against Trump, doing so in a   New York Times opinion piece earlier this month. Two sources from within the Republican National Committee told Politico the RNC has been in contact with most of the GOP electors numerous times and the committee is only aware of one elector, Suprun, who is at risk of voting against Trump. A candidate needs 270 votes to win the Electoral College. With Trump’s 306 electors, 37 would need to defect during Monday’s vote to put him below the majority needed to officially secure the presidency. Lessig was asked whether the entire effort was an exercise in futility given that the decision would be thrown to the   House if the Electoral College indeed failed to finalize Trump’s presidency. The law professor said he wasn’t certain the House would vote for Trump. He stated: “You know, in the House there are a lot of things that could happen. You know, people could judge the fact that he was the first president to be denied the nomination of the Electoral College for reasons like this. There was a vice president in 1836 who was denied. But he would be the first president as a kind of fatal blow. And in that House, the Republicans might consider, ‘Well, is there another candidate?’ It would have to be among the top three   of the Electoral College. But is there another candidate who we should nominate instead? And that’s why people have been talking about alternatives like [Republican Ohio Gov. John] Kasich. Or it could be anybody who gets the votes of the Electoral College that are in the top three. And such a move might actually for the nation be incredibly important to get beyond the horrendous political partisan divide that we now find ourselves in.  That might be a good reason for them to act like that. ” Last week, John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s top political adviser who served as chairman of her presidential campaign, expressed his support for a request by ten Electoral College voters to receive an intelligence briefing on claims of foreign intervention in the presidential election.   The number of electors singing on to that request has since ballooned to fifty. On Friday, UPI cited sources saying the Electoral College will not receive an intelligence briefing on the matter.

So I think it’s really not what Mr. Trump knew but what did Trump Inc. know and when did they know it? Were they in touch with the Russians? I think those are still open questions. The electors have a right to know what the answers are if the U. S. Government has those answers before the election. That’s also why I said there needs to be an independent investigation into this. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"

2016-12-20,"A search warrant that triggered the   in the days before the election was finally made public Tuesday. The FBI sought to gain further access to a silver Dell Inspiron laptop that was   a longtime Clinton aide. Emails related to Clinton were found on the laptop in an unrelated investigation into  . In total, 21 pages of documents, including the Oct. 30 search warrant, application and an affidavit, were released with redactions following a court order Monday. Neither Abedin nor Weiner are identified in the papers but Clinton’s name and references to the criminal investigation into her email use are mentioned throughout. Abedin’s name appears to be blacked out in several references to correspondence with Clinton. In an affidavit, an FBI agent, whose name was also blacked out, said there was probable cause to search the computer’s one terabyte hard drive because the agency knew Abedin and Clinton exchanged classified emails on a based on its previous investigation. “The subject laptop was never authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information,” the agent wrote. “A complete forensic analysis and review of the subject laptop will also allow the FBI to determine if there is any evidence of computer intrusion into the subject laptop and to determine if classified information was accessed by unauthorized users or transferred to any other unauthorized systems. ” Less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that the agency was seeking a search warrant to see whether the emails on the laptop were related to Clinton’s private email server. The warrant and related documents have been under seal since they were issued. But on Monday, Manhattan federal court Judge P. Kevin Castel ordered that redacted versions would be unsealed after Los   lawyer E. Randol Schoenberg petitioned to have them released. In a statement, Schoenberg said he was “appalled” at the language in the warrant. “I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Secretary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin,” he said. Two days before the election, Comey said the newfound emails did nothing to change his earlier position that Clinton should not be criminally charged  —   a move her team blamed for losing the election."

2016-12-22,"A spokesman for   Donald Trump’s transition team denies reports that Trump’s national security adviser General Michael Flynn had met with leaders of the Austrian Freedom Party. [“I wanted to also make sure we’re clear on one point with regard to General Flynn, there was some fake news out there regarding General Flynn and that he supposedly met with an Austrian politician,” Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said in a call with reporters.    Strache, the leader of the Austrian   Freedom Party, announced on Facebook that he had visited with Flynn at Trump Tower, prompting reports from the New York Times and other news outlets that the meeting had occurred. Several other outlets raised the alarm that the Austrian Freedom Party had Nazi sympathies and was founded by an former Nazi officer. “The fact of the matter is that General Flynn has never spoken with or met the Austrian politician in question and General Flynn strongly disavows groups with such attitudes and viewpoints,” Miller said."
2016-12-23,"The departure of 4, 000 rebel fighters and civilians on Thursday completed the evacuation of what was formerly   eastern Aleppo. They left the last square kilometre of territory which had remained under nominal rebel control after a Russia and   ceasefire effectively ended the battle on 13 December. Since then, about 40, 000 people have left the city amid worsening weather and humanitarian conditions in a fragile and   evacuation operation. Rebels had held eastern Aleppo since 2012, but a year of Russian bombing allowed   forces to gradually encircle their enclave before finally overrunning it in less than a month. With Syria’s civil war far from over, tens of thousands of former Aleppo residents now face a precarious future as refugees in   Idlib. With   Aleppo reduced to a small pocket on the west bank of the Aleppo river and reports of   militias killing civilians in newly captured territory in what the UN called a “meltdown of humanity” Russia and Turkey made a deal to evacuate rebels and civilians to Idlib province. But on the first full day of the ceasefire, renewed shelling and the refusal of the   militias who had led the regime assault to allow the evacuation put it in doubt.  The evacuation of east Aleppo  —   if it goes ahead  —   means the opposition will cede the entire city, Syria’s former commercial capital, to the Assad regime, surrendering the last major urban stronghold where it maintained an active presence.   territory was collapsing rapidly during Monday as   forces continuously rolled back the frontline in eastern Aleppo. Conditions inside the   rebel enclave were described as “doomsday” by one resident, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reporting the rebels had already withdrawn from all territory on the east bank of the Aleppo river. The day began with a   advance into the strategic districts of Sheikh Saeed and Saliheen, preceded by some of the most intense bombardment of the war. The fall of these areas alone meant the rebels had lost control of at least 90% of the territory they held before the regime launched its ground offensive just over two weeks ago. The Old City of Aleppo, long a bastion of the Syrian opposition, fell into regime hands after the rebels defending it withdrew fearing being cut off after government soldiers and   militia seized the neighbouring districts of Bab   and Aqyul.   forces also took parts of Marjeh as opposition ranks were reportedly divided on whether to leave the city or make a last stand.   troops moved to within a kilometre of Aleppo’s ancient citadel on Tuesday as   districts continued to fall. With up to 70% of eastern Aleppo now back in regime hands, there was fierce fighting as rebels lost control of more territory east of the narrow streets which surround the citadel. Regime forces built on momentum generated over a second consecutive weekend of heavy bombardment and rapid advances. On Monday, Russia vetoed a draft UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire, ensuring its ally in Damascus remained free to build on its advantage.   forces led by Iraqi Shia militias and Hezbollah seized control of up to   of   eastern Aleppo after another day of rapid advances. Rebel defences appear to have been fatally weakened since   airstrikes resumed with renewed ferocity nearly two weeks ago. The capture earlier in the day of the strategic Sakhour district consolidated Sunday’s regime gains into a wedge that effectively cut rebel territory in two. This manoeuvre briefly left open a small corridor through which rebels withdrew to a new frontline farther south, before   forces moved to occupy the entire northern third of the rebel enclave. After 12 days of intense preparatory airstrikes, forces supporting the Syrian president, Bashar   launched a major ground assault on   eastern Aleppo. The attack was concentrated on the northern part of the rebel enclave   forces had been consolidating their control north of this frontline since the siege began in late August. Opposition fighters retreated in the face of a regime advance that captured the areas of Jabal Badro and Masaken Hanano, which was the first district taken by rebels in 2012. Thousands of civilians fled to Kurdish and   territory."
2016-12-24,"’ Here’s what’s working.’ ’ The AirPods are small, lightweight, and hyper portable.’ ’ They do a great job of staying in your ear.’ ’ The wireless technology makes regular Bluetooth look dumb.’ ’ The design of the case is exceptional.’ ’ Battery life is surprisingly fantastic.’ ’ Sound quality is decent  —   but the killer feature is phone calls.’ ’ Here’s what’s not working.’ ’ The AirPods might be *too* small and discreet.’ ’ The   controls are very limiting.’ ’ The AirPods are     and that’s not good for sound or comfort.’ ’ If you’re not covering it up with hair or a hoodie, prepare to look a little bit like a cyborg.’ ’ *Final thoughts*’] I’ve been testing final production AirPods for about a week and   AirPods since September. The pods don’t fall out nearly as easily as one might expect of an     that dangles precariously from one’s ear, and I was equally impressed by the AirPods’ unique wireless technology that eliminates the fussiness of Bluetooth. But   volume control and the AirPods’     form factor aren’t ideal  —   and show that there’s a lot of room for improvement. The AirPods’ smooth, dental floss —  sized case slips easily into tight pant pockets. Together, the AirPods weigh about as much as a US quarter, just 0. 28 ounces, while the charging case is 1. 34 ounces  —   so altogether we’re talking about the same weight as a single Kit Kat bar. In your ear, you’ll feel the hard   of the AirPod, but you won’t feel bogged down by its weight. I really tried to get these buds to come out: I biked to work with one of them in, I headbanged to Slayer, and I tried shaking them out of my ears (even upside down! ). Nada.  Movement won’t dislodge the AirPods, but as soon as there’s some external interference, they immediately lose their mythical staying power. The stem is susceptible to getting caught on things like clothing, hair, and helmets. I took off my sweater and an AirPod went flying. I tucked my   hair behind my ear and the same thing happened. The helmet strap didn’t remove the AirPod from my ear, but it did jostle it around, which is unnerving when you’re biking on the streets of San Francisco. Apple products are designed in the context of an ~ecosystem~ which means there’s an extra feature for iPhones with iOS 10 installed. When you open the charging case within a   range of your iPhone, the AirPods are automatically synced. There are no settings menus to deal with, no tapping around, and no  .  I synced and unsynced the AirPods repeatedly, and it worked every time, without fail. This integration makes the wireless future seem more appealing. The AirPods can also automatically recognize iPads with iOS 10, Apple Watches with watchOS 3, and computers with macOS Sierra that are signed into the same iCloud account as whatever phone they are synced with. The pods will appear in Control Center (that menu you expand by swiping up from the bottom) on iOS and in the Bluetooth settings menu bar on laptops.  Other devices, like Android phones, can connect to the AirPods with good   Bluetooth. There’s a barely there button on the back of the case that puts the AirPods into pairing mode.  The Bluetooth range is fairly good, too, thanks to the included W1 Chip that helps the AirPods offer more distance while using up less battery. The connection only dropped for me a few times, when I’d walk across the office and duck behind a tall metal cabinet but, generally, the wireless connection is very consistent. I can usually go a few days without having to charge the AirPods or the case. AirPods have five hours of listening time each, and the charging case provides up to 24 hours of battery life.  Because the case also charges, whenever you pull out your AirPods, they have 100% battery (as long, of course, as the case has some power left). Most notably, a quick 15 minutes in the case charges the buds with three hours of listening time. That’s better than you’ll typically find elsewhere. Samsung’s Gear IconX and Bragi’s Dash wireless earbuds provide only three hours per charge (though Bragi’s Headphone lasts six hours). And, in case you’re curious, here’s how I test audio: The Knife’s “A Tooth for an Eye,” James Blake’s “Retrograde,” and Erykah Badu’s “Bag Lady” over Spotify.  The real power of the AirPods is actually revealed when you talk on the phone. My callers mentioned multiple times how   my voice sounded, even amidst the loud background noise of San Francisco streets. A   microphone on the tip of the stem picks up your voice and transmits   audio. This may be because the earbuds have an array of sensors (accelerometers, optical sensors, microphones, and antennas) that can detect when your jaw is moving, and optimize the microphones for a phone call by isolating voice audio. Not a joke: within 5 minutes I dropped an AirPod down the drain. Despite the number of sensors Apple was able to cram into each tiny AirPod, the way in which you can control them is restricted to Siri, including changing the volume. There are no manual controls.  Siri lives in the cloud, and that means you need to have INTERNET or a data connection every time you want to adjust the volume with the AirPods. If you’re without   or service  —   and there are still plenty of flights where you could be  —   you’ll have to pull out your phone.  It also means that if you’re walking outside, you’ll be shouting “NEXT SONG” or “TURN UP THE VOLUME” at random passersby. Additionally, for those of you familiar with Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home, Siri won’t respond to “louder,” only “turn up the volume. ” You can go into the Settings menu to switch the double tap function to control   instead of activating Siri, which marginally improves things. But unless you’re in an environment where you can talk to yourself all day, like commuting in a car, Siri isn’t helpful. Unlike most buds, like the Bragi and Samsung ones I’ve tried, the AirPods don’t include multiple earbud fit tips. For people with ears that skew on the smaller side, like me, that means that the AirPods always feel like they’re on the verge of falling out.  Apple designed the AirPods to fit most ears, after testing thousands of different shapes, but it’s possible that the Pods won’t work with yours. Fit is *especially* crucial for earbuds that don’t offer noise cancellation, and if you don’t have an average ear shape, then the AirPods might not sound or feel as good as they’re designed to. But for the $159 price tag and limited functionality, you’re better off waiting for   AirPods, and opting for a different wireless pair in the meantime. My current pick is the $130 Jaybirds X3, which aren’t cordless (a cable connects the two wingtip buds) but have incredible sound and excellent range, and are   comfortable, and lightweight. If you must have a wireless, cordless earbud, I don’t have a good answer for you yet. I like the $150 Bragi Headphone so far, because it’s more comfortable, fits better, and is more understated than the AirPods  —   but the company is currently having issues with shipping and delivery. The $300 Dash is a waterproof fitness tracker in addition to a Bluetooth headset, which is cool, but the connection quality isn’t consistent (read our entire review for more). In my testing, the Samsung Gear IconX was light and sounded great, but battery life kind of stunk. There’s also the    Here One earbuds that I haven’t tried yet (more on those to come! ).  Apple  —   and other Bluetooth earbud makers in the space  —   haven’t nailed ~truly wireless~ hardware just yet. The premise of wireless earbuds is attractive (weightless audio, the freedom of being  ) but it’s still a nascent technology and, unless you’re an early adopter who’s used to dealing with kinks in   products, you’ll be disappointed.

2016-12-25,"Full transcript below of Pope Frances’s Christmas Eve homily, delivered at St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican. Transcript by Rome Reports and the CTV broadcast of the mass.[ “The grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all” (Tit 2:11). The words of the Apostle Paul reveal the mystery of this holy night: the grace of God has appeared, his free gift. In the Child given to us, the love of God is made visible. It is a night of glory, that glory proclaimed by the angels in Bethlehem and also by us today, throughout the world. It is a night of joy, because this date forth and for all times, the infinite and eternal God is God with us. He is never far off. We need not search for him in the heavens or in mystical notions. He is close. He became man and he will never distance himself from our humanity, which he has made his own. It is a night of light. The light prophesied by Isaiah (cf. 9:1) which was to shine on those who walked in a land of darkness, has appeared and enveloped the shepherds of Bethlehem (cf. Lk 2:9). The shepherds discover simply that “a child has been born to us” (Is 9:5). They realize that all this glory, all this joy, all this light, converges to a single point, the sign that the angel indicated to them: “You will find a child wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger” (Lk 2:12). This is the enduring sign for all who would find Jesus. Not just then, but also today. If we want to celebrate Christmas authentically, we need to contemplate this sign: the frail simplicity of a tiny newborn child, the meekness with which he is placed in a manger, the tender affection with which he is wrapped in his swaddling clothes. God is there.        "
2016-12-26,"The Obama administration has accepted 25, 584 refugees into the United States in the two months and 26 days since FY 2017 began on October 1, according to the Department of State interactive website. That number is nearly double the 13, 791 refugees accepted during the comparable period between October 1, 2015 and December 26, 2015 of the prior fiscal year (FY 2016). [It is also more than the previous high for the Obama administration during his eight years in office, which occurred in FY 2013 when 18, 228 refugees were accepted between October 1, 2012 and December 26, 2012.  The Obama administration appears to be rushing as many refugees as possible into the country before   Donald Trump is inaugurated as the 45th President on January 20, 2017. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to pause the resettlement of refugees who come from Syria or other countries that have a history of hostility to the United States. During FY 2016, 85, 000 refugees were resettled in the United States. The Obama administration has asked Congress for budget authority to resettle 110, 000 refugees in the country during FY 2017. Congress, however, has not authorized that level of spending under the interim budget for FY 2017 that will continue into March 2017. Authorized spending simply continues at the 85, 000 annualized refugee levels. If the current level of refugee resettlement continues for the remaining nine months of FY 2017, more than 100, 000 refugees will be resettled, even though how the resettlement agencies would fund the additional 15, 000 refugees who are not in the interim budget remains unknown. If Trump follows through on his campaign promise, however, the number of refugees resettled in FY 2016 is likely to fall below 85, 000. The Obama administration continues to accelerate the resettlement of refugees from countries that the new administration is likely to place on the “pause” list: Syria and Somalia. Since October 1, 3, 542 refugees have been resettled in the United States from Syria, an annualized rate of more than 14, 000, an increase from the 12, 500 resettled in FY 2016. During that same time period, 3, 474 refugees have been resettled from Somalia, an annualized rate of slightly less than 14, 000, which is a significant increase from the 9, 020 resettled in FY 2016. The Obama administration has continued to place the greatest number of Syrian refugees in Michigan, a politically tone deaf act given the role opposition to refugee resettlement played in   Trump’s upset victory there in November. Three hundred and   Syrian refugees have been resettled in Michigan since October 1, more than in any other state in the country. California hosts the second highest number of recent Syrian refugees during that period, with 372. Rounding out the top five destination states for recent Syrian refugees are Pennsylvania (261) Texas (245) and Florida (202). Both Pennsylvania and Florida were swing states that voted for Trump in November. Texas Governor Greg Abbott recently wrote a letter to the Obama administration withdrawing the Lone Star State from the federal refugee resettlement program, potentially setting the stage for a Tenth Amendment lawsuit to end the program there, similar to the one Tennessee will soon file. Despite public concern over recent incidents of violence committed by Somali refugees (Dahir Adan’s September attack on ten at a Minnesota mall and Abdul Razak Ali Artan’s November attack on eleven on the campus of Ohio State) the Obama administration has accelerated the settlement of Somali refugees in the country since October 1. Of the 3, 474 Somali refugees resettled in the country since October 1, 433 were resettled in Minnesota, the state where Dahir Adan resided, which is already home to the largest Somali community in the United States, which is estimated to total 70, 000. Rounding out the top five states to receive Somali refugees since October 1 are New York (343) Ohio (248) Kentucky (239) and Arizona (225)."
2016-12-27,"JERUSALEM (AP)  —   Doubling down on its public break with the Obama administration, a furious Israeli government on Tuesday said it had received ”ironclad” information from Arab sources that Washington actively helped craft last week’s U. N. resolution declaring Israeli settlements in occupied territories illegal. The allegations further poisoned a toxic atmosphere between Israel and the outgoing administration in the wake of Friday’s vote, raising questions about whether the White House might take further action against settlements in President Barack Obama’s final weeks in office. With the U. S. expected to participate in an international peace conference in France next month and Secretary of State John Kerry planning a final policy speech, the Palestinians hope to capitalize on the momentum. Israel’s nationalist government is banking on the incoming Trump administration to undo the damage with redoubled support. Although the U. S. has long opposed the settlements, it has generally used its Security Council veto to protect its ally from censure. On Friday, it abstained from a resolution calling settlements a ”flagrant violation” of international law, allowing it to pass by a   margin. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had a cool relationship with Obama, called the resolution ”shameful” and accused the U. S. of playing an active role in its passage. On Tuesday, his spokesman went even further. ”We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage,” David Keyes said. ”We’re not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night.” He did not identify the Arab sources or say how Israel obtained the information. Israel has close security ties with Egypt, the original sponsor of last week’s resolution who, as the lone Arab member of the Security Council, was presenting it at the Palestinians’ request. Under heavy Israeli pressure, Egypt delayed the resolution indefinitely  —   but other members presented it for a vote a day later. Egypt ended up voting in favor of the measure. The Obama administration has vehemently denied Israel’s allegations. ”We did not draft, advance, promote, or even tell any other country how we would vote on this resolution in advance of the Egyptians putting it in blue last week,” said White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. The Obama administration has acknowledged that it considered the possibility of abstaining on a settlements resolution over the past year as various drafts were circulated by different countries. In announcing the abstention, U. N. Ambassador Samantha Power referred to continued Israeli settlement construction and a recent effort to retroactively legalize dozens of illegally built settlement outposts. A White House official said the U. S. was approached repeatedly by countries urging it to let the resolution pass, yet only replied by saying the U. S. would feel forced to veto any resolution that didn’t also criticize the Palestinians for inciting violence. The official wasn’t authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity. The Palestinians, with strong international backing, seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967, as part of an independent state. They say continued Israeli settlement undermines that goal, since already some 600, 000 Israelis live in these areas. Israel is livid that the resolution does not appear to recognize its claim to any part of the occupied areas, including Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem’s Old City, though the resolution leaves the door open to agreed land swaps. The Palestinians did not embrace several past peace offers that would have left them with a state on the vast majority of the land, with a foothold in Jerusalem. Past Security Council resolutions on the issue have been more vague. Critics of Israel argue that by insisting on the settlements, Netanyahu has earned the global impatience. Netanyahu has made no secret that he is counting on   Donald Trump to contain the damage. Trump has indicated he will be far more sympathetic, and has appointed an ambassador with deep ties to the settler movement. Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev, a close Netanyahu ally, dismissed Obama. ”He is history,” she told Channel 2 TV. ”We have Trump.” The resolution seems largely symbolic, lacking any enforcement mechanism. But Palestinians believe it will strengthen their position as they push on with a campaign to pressure Israel on the international stage. President Mahmoud Abbas said Tuesday he hopes an upcoming Mideast conference in France will lead to concrete measures. ”We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,” Abbas told a meeting of his Fatah party. ”The (resolution) proves that the world rejects the settlements, as they are illegal.” Husam Zumlot, an adviser to Abbas, told The Associated Press the Palestinians want the resolution to serve as a ”foundation” for any future peace talks. He also said the Palestinians would use the text to bolster their case at the International Criminal Court, where they are trying to push a war crimes case against Israel over settlement policies. French officials expect some 70 nations to participate in the Jan. 15 conference. Israel and the Palestinians are not expected to be invited, though officials are considering inviting the Israeli and Palestinian leaders for   talks. Abbas seems open to this, while Netanyahu has chafed, saying international dictates undermine negotiations. Netanyahu has instead called off a number of diplomatic meetings and visits with countries that supported the resolution. On Wednesday, a Jerusalem municipal council is expected to grant building permits for roughly 600 new homes in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem. Deputy Jerusalem Mayor Meir Turgeman, who heads the zoning committee, also said this week he will push plans for some 5, 600 additional housing units in the eastern part. A municipal official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said those projects are only in their preliminary phases. ___, Associated Press writer Josh Lederman in Honolulu contributed.

2016-12-28," Carrie Fisher, the actor catapulted into science fiction superstardom through her role of Princess Leia in the Star Wars films, has died. She was 60. Family spokesman Simon Halls confirmed to BuzzFeed News that the actor passed away Tuesday. “It is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8:55 this morning,” Halls said in a statement. “She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly. ” Fisher reportedly suffered from cardiac arrest on a flight to LA from London on Dec. 23. Fisher’s mother, actor Debbie Reynolds, released a statement on Facebook Tuesday, thanking everyone “who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter. ” Her   Joely Fisher, broke her silence on Twitter, she said, “with a broken heart. ” “The Unfathomable loss  …    the earth is off its axis today  …    how dare you take her away from us,” she tweeted. The actor was revered for her portrayal of Princess Leia Organa in the 1977 blockbuster Star Wars  —   a clever, diplomatic soldier cut from royal cloth who could fire a gun and charm an android. With her iconic “cinnamon bun” hairstyle, Fisher’s Leia first appeared onscreen requiring rescue from   Kenobi  —   but she was no simple damsel in distress, quickly proving herself a cunning rebel warrior and symbol of female empowerment. Star Wars scion George Lucas called her “colorful personality” and talented actor in a statement Wednesday: In Star Wars she was our great and powerful princess  —   feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think. My heart and prayers are with Billie, Debbie and all Carrie’s family, friends and fans. She will be missed by all. Her Star Wars   also remembered Fisher. Mark Hamill, better known as Luke Skywalker, tweeted that he had “no words” and was “devastated. ” Harrison Ford, who played Leia’s love interest, Han Solo, memorialized Fisher as “brilliant” and “original” in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Carrie was      …    brilliant, original. Funny and emotionally fearless,” Ford said. “She lived her life, bravely  …    My thoughts are with her daughter Billie, her mother Debbie, her brother Todd, and her many friends. We will all miss her. ” Disney CEO Bob Iger also released the following statement on the actor’s passing, calling her    : In addition to starring in the next two sequels, Fisher appeared in films from The Blues Brothers in 1980 to When Harry Met Sally in 1989. She remained onscreen for years to come, reprising her role as Leia in Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015. The film’s director, JJ Abrams, said in a statement that Fisher was “beautiful, tough and wonderful. ” “You didn’t need to meet Carrie Fisher to understand her power,” he said. “She was just as brilliant and beautiful, tough and wonderful, incisive and funny as you could imagine. What an unfair thing to lose her. How lucky to have been blessed with her at all. ” Fisher struggled at times with alcohol and drugs, a subject she addressed in a 2006   play, Wishful Drinking, which she later adapted into a book. “Happy is one of the many things I’m likely to be over the course of a day and certainly over the course of a lifetime,” Fisher wrote. “But I think if you have the expectation that you’re going to be happy throughout your life  —   more to the point, if you have a need to be comfortable all the time  —   well, among other things, you have the makings of a classic drug addict or alcoholic. ” Her humanizing, hilarious, and   take on internal battles helped cement Fisher’s status as a cultural icon who used the platform to become an advocate for mental health treatment. In November Fisher released her eighth book entitled The Princess Diarist  —   a memoir based on excerpts from her diary entries beginning in the 1970s when she was filming the first Star Wars. In the eclectic autobiography, Fisher reveals that she had a secret affair with her   Harrison Ford, who was married at the time. Carrie Frances Fisher was born Oct. 21, 1956, in Beverly Hills, California, to a family with deep roots in show business  —   her father was singer Eddie Fisher and her mother is actor Debbie Reynolds. Her siblings are also actors: Todd Fisher, Joely Fisher, and Tricia Leigh Fisher.  "
2016-12-29,"  Trump is busy these days with victory tours,   and foreign policy tweets. But he’s also finding time to think about his inauguration. He huddled this week with presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who later told CNN they had discussed the inaugural addresses of previous presidents. Brinkley emerged from the    at    resort in Florida to say Trump was not planning a   on Jan. 20. ”He doesn’t want it to be long,” Brinkley told CNN. ”He doesn’t want people standing out in the cold.” In other words, Brinkley added, he doesn’t want to be like William Henry Harrison, who in 1841 gave the longest inaugural speech ever (an hour and 45 minutes in a snowstorm) and served the shortest time in the White House, dying of pneumonia one month after the speech. That disaster aside, the inaugural address has become a major feature of a new presidency, thanks in large part to the mass media of the 20th century. But at the very beginning, the remarks were delivered not to an adoring throng of supporters but a gaggle of congressmen and other officials. Perhaps that is why George Washington did not feel required to inspire with his opening line at his first inauguration in 1789. To wit: ”Among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, received on the 14th day of this month.” Some of that humility persisted four years later when Washington penned his second inaugural address. Just 135 words, it remains the shortest inaugural to this day. The inaugural addresses we often remember best were those delivered at the worst times in our national history. Most everyone has heard at least some of the speech Abraham Lincoln worked for weeks writing in 1861. With war between the states looming, the new president tried desperately to slow the spread of disunion. ”We are not enemies, but friends,” Lincoln concluded. ”We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.” Stirring words to be sure, but not successful. Secessionist forces would fire on the federal Fort Sumter in South Carolina the next month, and four years of civil war would follow. In the depths of the Great Depression in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to translate his landslide election into new confidence for the nation as he intoned the words: ”The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Roosevelt went on to decry ”nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” And he added a note of hope: ”In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.” FDR himself found a great deal of support, winning   three times. But the depression lingered through the decade and was only surmounted with the onset of World War II. No president has taken the oath in such dire circumstances since, but several inaugural addresses have been regarded as pivotal. According to Brinkley, Trump himself mentioned the speeches by John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Many were inspired by Kennedy’s iconic performance in 1961. The youngest person ever elected president, Kennedy at 43 seemed to embody the spirit of his times with his address: ”Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans  —   born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage . ..” Moving as those words were, they were eclipsed by the exhortation that came after: ”And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” A generation of his fellow Americans would do just that, in the military, in the Peace Corps, and in countless other forms of public service. Few may have realized at the time, but Kennedy’s shining words were not entirely his own. Roosevelt and other presidents had depended on staff and advisers in composing their speeches. But with Kennedy there emerged the speechwriter as star in the person of Ted Sorensen. Sorensen had joined Kennedy’s team in 1953, the year the future president entered the Senate. Sorensen had been raised and educated in Nebraska, but he had an immediate rapport with the scion of the   Kennedy clan. The   Midwesterner would have a hand in nearly all Kennedy’s most famous utterances  —   including the book Profiles in Courage, for which the senator was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. Sorensen himself always downplayed his own role, denying authorship. In an interview with NPR’s Scott Simon in 2009, at the age of 81, Sorensen had this to say: ”Let’s just say that my work over an   period with John F. Kennedy was a collaborative process, and I would not remember now who provided one word or one line. But John F. Kennedy was the author of his inaugural address because he’s the man who made the decisions on what policies and values to enunciate.” Ronald Reagan was renowned for his speaking prowess long before he became president, although he too had speechwriters he relied upon  —   including longtime California politico Ken Khachigian. In his inaugural address in 1981, Reagan strove to put a postscript to the politics of FDR and JFK with this pithy judgment: ”In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem.” In Reagan’s later years, one of his writers gained considerable profile in her own right. Peggy Noonan would also write major speeches for the first President Bush. Noonan went on to be a newspaper columnist, as did Michael Gerson, who gained a measure of fame writing for the second President Bush. Among Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were known for their way with words. Obama in particular rose to national prominence as a speechmaker. But both also had numerous writers with whom they worked. Which brings us to the present day and the case of   Trump. Brinkley reported that Trump told him he’d started working on his address and planned to produce it himself. But his transition team has said he is also working with Stephen Miller, a former Senate staffer for Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions who has been on the Trump campaign staff for more than a year. At 31, Miller is a year younger than Sorensen was when Kennedy took the oath. Raised in Southern California, he came east to attend Duke University before coming to work for Sessions. Like Sorensen, Miller is very much a policy adviser as well as a wordsmith  —   motivated by the immigration issue in particular. Miller often spoke at Trump rallies during 2016, whipping up the crowd with harsh attacks on Hillary Clinton before Trump stepped on stage. He is also credited with drafting the acceptance speech Trump gave at the Republican Convention in July, a speech widely regarded as an indictment of life in the current U. S. a dark description of the nation’s economic, social and cultural condition. But Miller is also said to have provided the prepared remarks Trump sometimes used on the stump in the fall  —   remarks that kept the candidate ”on message” and minimized   controversy in the campaign’s final days. If Miller is indeed a major contributor to the Trump inaugural address, which Miller is likely to shine through? The crowd outside the West Front of the Capitol that day will be larger than any Trump rally to date, with tens of millions more watching around the world. And the Trump transition team has said the tone of the day will be uplift. Whatever the tone or the message, history tells us the first day of the Trump presidency will be remembered largely for the words the new president speaks."
2016-12-30,"Wall Street’s whiplashed year is finally over. The stock market ended 2016 with a whimper on Friday, a muted close for the most dramatic year for investors since the financial crisis, as major indices were rocked by seismic shifts in the global political order from the US to China. The Dow Jones industrial average smashed through record after record this year, with at least 20 sessions ending on   highs before ending the year up 13. 4 percent. More than half the gains this year for the Dow have come since Nov. 8, after Donald Trump was elected president. “Since Election Day, the returns have been parabolic,” Sam Stovall, an analyst at CFRA, told The Post. On Friday, the final trading day of the year, the index fell slightly, by 0. 3 percent, to 19, 762. 60. Still, the Dow finished with its   annual gain in the last eight years, since the end of the financial crisis. That only tells part of the story of a volatile year: The Dow ended up rising more than 25 percent from its low point in February to its   high. Other broad measures of US stocks also logged solid gains. The S&P 500, which measures a broader range of US companies, rose 9. 4 percent to 2238. 83. The Nasdaq Composite, which largely tracks technology stocks, ended the year up 7. 5 percent to 5383. 12. Chipmaker Nvidia led both those indexes, more than tripling in value, after announcing that it will work with Chinese company Baidu to develop   cars. Wall Street started the year in a bad way, as the price of oil collapsed and fears about China’s economy sent investors scrambling. The Dow fell 1, 078. 58 points during the first five days, making for the   start to the year. By Feb. 11, the Dow had fallen to a low of 15, 660. 18 after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen hinted that she would continue to raise borrowing costs  —   something she didn’t follow through on until December. For months, the price of oil dictated the direction of the markets. OPEC continued to pump oil even as a global supply glut dragged the price of a barrel down to $26. 21 on Feb. 11. Since then, the commodity has more than doubled in value to around $53. 57 as OPEC has clamped down on production. On June 24, after the UK shocked the world with a vote to leave the European Union, stocks tanked around the world. About $420 billion was wiped out of the S&P 500 that day alone. The Great British Pound collapsed 10 percent against the dollar and never recovered. But it was the surprise election of Trump that sent markets skyrocketing at the end of the year. Wall Street had assumed that Hillary Clinton would win the election. Some of the biggest CEOs, including JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs’ Lloyd Blankfein, openly supported her. But late on Nov. 8, after it was clear that Clinton had lost three crucial states  —   and would therefore lose the election  —   Dow Jones futures had collapsed, and investors predicted that stocks would open down about 750 points. The opposite happened. After digesting the news, investors bought everything in sight, based on assumptions that Trump would cut corporate taxes, spend billions on infrastructure programs and reduce regulations. Caterpillar was the Dow’s biggest gainer, rising more than 36 percent. The Trump rally lasted more than 40 days, sending the Dow across 19, 000 just two days before Thanksgiving, and ending just below 20, 000 for the final two weeks of the year."
2016-12-31,"’   The promotion of fake news is a big problem that sites like   Facebook and Google are scrambling to fix.
